      <h1>Here are Cape Town’s proposed car licence fees for 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://businesstech.co.za/news/author/staff-writer/" target="_blank">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>The Western Cape Provincial Government has gazetted proposed motor vehicle licence fee increases for 2020.</p>
      <p>The draft regulation outlines the fees for cars, motorcycles, trucks, trailers and caravans.</p>
      <p>The average increase proposed is approximately 4.5%, which is in line with inflation.</p>
      <p>Licence fees are, among other activities, predominantly used for maintenance and building of the road infrastructure, the Western Cape government said.</p>
      <p>These vehicle licence fees are typically used by the provincial government to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Build, upgrade and maintain the provincially-owned road network.</li>
        <li>Assist municipalities to fund the maintenance of their more strategic roads.</li>
        <li>Continue to reduce the maintenance backlog, which has been decreased by over 16% over the last 7 years.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can find the list of the most important proposed fees detailed below.</p>
