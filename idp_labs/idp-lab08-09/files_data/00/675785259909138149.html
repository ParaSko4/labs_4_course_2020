      <h2>Strictly Come Dancing fans were left baffled over short clip of Michelle Visage's 'best bits' - something that had never happened before</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:02:49+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 00:02</time> by <a rel="author">Brogan-Leigh Hurst</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> fans were left puzzled by the new feature added on tonight's results show which saw Michelle Visage leave.</p>
      <p>When the Strictly hosts announced Michelle, 51, would be the latest celeb to depart from the show, a flashback of her best memories was shown.</p>
      <p>However it hadn't been done in previous episodes, so fans were left confused over the new move.</p>
      <p>One <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> user asked: "How come Michelle got a best bits? No one else has?"</p>
      <p>Another said: "Wait, do they usually do best bits?"</p>
      <p>And a third added: "Why is Michelle getting 'best bits' they haven't done that for others?"</p>
      <p>Michelle became the eighth celebrity to leave Strictly Come Dancing, leaving her co-stars stunned.</p>

      <p>The Drag Race star was previously hailed as the potential winner of the BBC dancing competition, so her exit came as a shock to many viewers.</p>
      <p>She and Giovanni Pernice landed in the bottom two with YouTuber Saffron Barker and AJ Pritchard, meaning both couples had to dance again.</p>
      <p>Michelle and Giovanni performed their couples choice dance, which was street commercial, to Madonna's iconic Vogue.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile Saffron and AJ Quickstepped to Beverley Knight's Marvellous Party in a bid to impress the judges.</p>
      <p>Craig Revel Horwood deliberated over the decision, admitting that he found it difficult to pick who to save.</p>
      <p>Eventually, however, he said: "I'm having a really difficult time with myself over this. This doesn’t normally happen to me. I normally make a very quick, instant decision. This has been really, really difficult.</p>

      <p>"One couple took all the notes on board and one couple were better. And the couple I've decided I would like to save is save is Saffron and AJ."</p>
      <p>Motsi Mabuse also decided to save Saffron and AJ after saying that they had seen "two brilliant dances".</p>
      <p>Finally, Bruno Tonioli agreed, saying that Saffron and AJ's dance was "on the money".</p>
