      <p>The Deputy Senate President, <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/ovie-omo-agege/"><u><b>Ovie Omo-Agege</b></u></a>, has congratulated the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress in Bayelsa State, <b>David Lyon,</b> on his victory during the November 16 election.</p>
      <p>Omo-Agege in a statement through his spokesperson, Yomi Odunuga, appreciated Bayelsans for voting for the APC candidate, he promised that they would not be disappointed.</p>
      <p>He also lauded the state and national leadership of the APC particularly the National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole; Minister of State for Petroleum, Timipre Sylva and other leaders who contributed to the victory of the party during the election.</p>
      <p>He added that the victory is a sign that the victory of APC during the last General Election was not a fluke.</p>
      <p>Omo-Agege reminded Lyon that the people of Bayelsa state expects an unreserved commitment to delivering the dividends of democracy to them.</p>
      <p>He charged aggrieved candidates to seek redress in court rather than resort to violence.</p>
      <p>He expressed happiness for the APC in Bayelsa for finally breaking the jinx by becoming the second state in the South-South after Edo to come under APC’s control.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“With this development and the actualisation of the Next Level Agenda of the APC-led administration, it is certain that our party will clinch more states in the South-South geo-political zone in future elections.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Like I have always said, it is possible for the APC to rule in the South-South beyond Edo. And I have been proven right with the final results from Bayelsa.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“This goes to show that with determination and tenacity of purpose, we can overcome what seems insurmountable.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Recall that <b><a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/18/inec-declares-apcs-david-lyon-winner-of-bayelsa-election/"><u>Naija News</u></a></b> reported that Lyon scored 352, 552 votes to win in the election while his closest rival, Diri, of the PDP, polled 143, 172 votes.</p>
