      <p>LAS VEGAS (AP) - Ticketholders to the Las Vegas Golden Knights’ shutout victory against <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/the-calgary-flames/">the Calgary Flames</a> may have to wait or drive farther to get free doughnuts.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/krispy-kreme/">Krispy Kreme</a>, which offers fans with a game ticket a dozen free doughnuts the day after a shutout game, closed multiple Las Vegas-area locations Monday.</p>
      <p>A note posted at one store says the stores are closed until 4 p.m. because of a change in ownership.</p>
      <p>The closure is needed while the company installs new computers, cash registers and security equipment.</p>
      <p>The Knights shared on Twitter that all Las Vegas locations will do the promotion through Tuesday night.</p>
