      <p>BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/serbia/">Serbia</a>’s president has been released from the hospital where he was treated for cardiovascular problems over the weekend.</p>
      <p>State TV broadcaster <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rts/">RTS</a> quoted officials as saying <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/aleksandar-vucic/">Aleksandar Vucic</a> is feeling better after being admitted to the military hospital in Belgrade on Friday.</p>
      <p>No other details were immediately available. Serbian media have reported in the past that the 49-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/aleksandar-vucic/">Vucic</a> suffers from high blood pressure.</p>
      <p>Pro-government media say his condition worsened following “inappropriate” questions by journalists about alleged corruption by government ministers.</p>

        <p>A former extreme nationalist during the 1990s war in Yugoslavia, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/aleksandar-vucic/">Vucic</a> and his Serbian Progressive Party came to power seven years ago promising to take <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/serbia/">Serbia</a> into the European Union. The populist leader has since faced accusations of curbing media freedoms and democracy.</p>
