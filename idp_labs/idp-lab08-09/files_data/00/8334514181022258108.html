      <p>The collision between the pair, one a young charger and the other a four times world champion, who have been battling for supremacy this season, provided a major talking point at Interlagos.</p>
      <p>Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto said he was disappointed.</p>
      <p>“I feel sorry for the team, I think the drivers need to feel sorry for the team,” he said.</p>
      <p>With second place in the constructors’ championship secure, Ferrari had told their drivers they were free to fight for their own positions, but with some stipulations.</p>
      <p>“Free to fight, but they know that silly mistakes are something we should avoid for the team itself,” said Binotto, who refrained from casting judgement before a thorough analysis back in Maranello.</p>
      <p>“At the end I think both of them got a small percentage of responsibility,” said the boss, who felt a podium had been missed.</p>
      <p>“They know that silly mistakes are still silly mistakes. What happened today is a shame for the team.”</p>
      <p>Leclerc, on fresher tyres, passed Vettel for fourth place towards the end of the race but the German came back at him on the outside.</p>
      <p>What looked like a light contact ended with both cars suffering race-ending damage, Leclerc’s front right suspension breaking while Vettel suffered a rear puncture. Both retired with the safety car then deployed.</p>
      <p>Damon Hill, the 1996 world champion who is now a pundit for Sky Sports television, said he would give both a talking to in Binotto’s shoes.</p>
      <p>“I think you have to sit them both down and say, ‘Listen guys, you can’t just behave like kids with the team like this. You have a responsibility, both of you, to the team’,” said the Briton, who felt Vettel should take more of the blame.</p>
      <p>Both drivers were summoned to stewards post-race, with no further action taken.</p>
      <p>Leclerc, 22, said he had spoken to Binotto immediately after the race but not to Vettel.</p>
      <p>“I’m pretty sure we are mature enough to put that behind us,” he added of the incident. “At the end we both of us feel extremely sorry for the team.”</p>
