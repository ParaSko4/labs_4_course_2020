        <b>BBVA is introducing a policy of digital disconnection for employees in Spain, encouraging them to put down their devices and take a break from the emails outside of working hours.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The policy is part of a wider effort to encourage a healthy work-life balance, fostering a flexible environment that is centred on achieving goals, not "presenteeism".<br/><br/>BBVA wants to move away from the corporate norm of people checking their work emails over dinner or in bed, ruling that no communications should be sent between 7:00pm and 8:00am, except for "justified expectations".<br/><br/>In addition, following a deal with unions, the bank is also set to start tracking employee hours in an effort to prevent overwork. From this month, Spanish staffers must register through a new app the time they start and finish working.<br/><br/>Corporate headquarters will start closing at 7:00pm, with services such as restaurants, transportation and gyms adapting to the new schedule.</p>

      <p>BBVA is also making changes to transportation for staffers, increasing the number of shuttles from Ciudad BBVA to the centre of Madrid, as well as promoting car-pooling and building car parks that encourage environmentally friendly means of transportation, such as electric scooters.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, meetings will be limited to 45 minutes, with attendees encouraged to join via video conferencing.<br/><br/>While the plan is initially only for Spain, over time it will be rolled out in other countries, adapting to the each market's different characteristics. <br/><br/>Carlos Casas, global head, talent and culture, BBVA, says: "We want to reinforce key principles in our organisation: working hard toward goals, being more productive and efficient, and offering employees greater flexibility and balance in their professional and personal lives."</p>
