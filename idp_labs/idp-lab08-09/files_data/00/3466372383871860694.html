      <p>An avalanche hit army positions in the Siachen glacier after which eight personnel were stuck under the snow. The avalanche had hit the army positions in the northern glacier around 3:30 pm on Monday.</p>
      <p>The altitudes in the northern glacier are around 18,000 feet and above, according to sources.</p>
      <p>The army personnel hit by the avalanche were part of a patrolling party consisting of eight persons and were in the northern glacier when the incident happened.</p>
      <p>Sources said that the patrolling party, including porters, were evacuating another person who had fallen sick at his post.</p>
      <p>Siachen Glacier is the world's highest battlefield and more troops have been killed in weather and terrain-related incidents in the area than in enemy firing.</p>
      <p>India has deployed troops in its territory since 1984 after Pakistan tried to usurp the glacier by sending its troops and mountaineering expeditions in the area.Â </p>
