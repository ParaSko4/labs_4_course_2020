      <h1>WT.Social is Interesting, But Can It Work? Well, Maybe.</h1>

      <p>Let’s be honest, social media is a double-edged sword. On one hand we love to share our lives and get that juicy dopamine hit when people like it, but we can’t deny the <a href="http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/27358/1/PubSub5118_Griffiths.pdf">increased narcissism</a>, the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/05/why-social-media-ruining-political-discourse/589108/">influence of our political discourse</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2018/02/05/579554273/screen-addiction-among-teens-is-there-such-a-thing">screen addiction</a>, <a href="https://parenting.firstcry.com/articles/impact-of-social-media-on-children/#:~:targetText=Psychologists%20have%20long%20observed%20bad,their%20emotional%20and%20social%20development.">influence on kids</a>, and other elements.So, we often bemoan social media, but with few exceptions, we go back to the teat for our daily dose. Lather, rinse, repeat.</p>
      <p>For years we have been saying that social media needs to be fixed. The social media companies, such as Twitter and Facebook, who have grown up in a time of unparalleled scrutiny of their services have made small adjustments, but otherwise few major changes.</p>
      <p>Well, to add a new dimension to this story, who should come riding into view? Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia with his new initiative, <a href="https://wt.social/">WT.Social</a>.</p>
      <h3>WT.Social</h3>
      <p>A spin-off from <a href="https://www.wikitribune.com/">WikiTribune</a>, WT.Social is designed to be a social media network focused on news sharing and discussion. It seems to blend a little bit of the collaborative editing nature of Wikipedia with social media. Wales <a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2019/11/16/wikipedia-jimmy-wales-facebook-social-network-competition/">hopes to attract 50 million users to the platform</a>.</p>

      <p>I <i>love</i> the idea behind WT.Social. I want it to be successful. Similarly, I believe communities can play an enormously powerful role in curating and presenting content. I think if Wales and his team can architect WT.Social effectively (incorporating some of their know-how from the impressive experience of Wikipedia), they could produce a powerful platform for consuming and sharing news.</p>
      <p>While I haven’t had an opportunity to use it yet (it is currently waitlisted), there are though <b>five</b> key elements that will need to be incorporated for it to succeed.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. The platform is not the driver. Content and conversation is</b>
      </p>
      <p>People don’t use social media networks because of how they work. They use them because they have <i>content, people, and communities they care about</i>. People use Facebook to keep up to date with their friends, they use Twitter to see what their friends, favorite brands, and celebrities are doing, they use LinkedIn to learn about people’s careers and work, and they use Reddit to meet people who share similar interests.</p>
      <p>As such, WT.Social needs to put content and reasonable, diverse conversation front and center. People won’t use it because it is WT.Social. They will use it because it becomes a regular drip-feed of news that presents an objective view of the story. This will gradually build usage and eventually become a powerful place to find news.</p>
      <p>This can be a tough pill to swallow for platform companies who think in terms of platforms. Here, content and discussion need to be the key drivers.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. People generally don’t pay for social media</b>
      </p>
      <p>I actually wonder if WT.Social is really a social media platform. It seems to me more of a collaborative platform for sharing and understanding news, but presented in a social media way.</p>
      <p>The distinction is important because broadly, the majority of people don’t pay for social media. People will often pay for quality content (e.g. Netflix, Spotify, Udemy, etc), and they will pay to advertise on social media networks, but the vast majority of social media networks are free to use as a general consumer.</p>
      <p>Now, on this note, Jimmy Wales <a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2019/11/16/wikipedia-jimmy-wales-facebook-social-network-competition/">said</a>, “The business model of social-media companies, of pure advertising, is problematic. It turns out the huge winner is low-quality content”. He isn’t wrong, but the question is how do you build momentum and high-levels of user growth while providing a high-quality of content?</p>
      <p>Now, I am not sure that quality and money are mutually exclusive concepts. For example, various Quora, Reddit, StackExchange, and other communities have very high quality content that is entirely freely produced: they key is in how they are moderated. More on this later.</p>
      <p>I am not entirely sure how they are going to square this circle.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. Simple consumption and publication is essential</b>
      </p>
      <p>One of the innovations of social media networks is blasting enormous amounts of content into people’s eyeballs at high speed.</p>
      <p>Prior to social media, content was scattered all over the Internet, available via search engines and link referrals. Each website had its own level of quality, different user interfaces for browsing content, and other complexities. Social media changed all of that: it created an endless visual timeline of content which you could scroll through. This delivered an enormously gratifying experience for most users.</p>
      <p>This presentation of information is going to be essential for WT.Social to succeed. Users need to be able to able to easily find, browse, and scan news on their cell phones and laptops. Google have already cracked some elements of this with <a href="https://news.google.com/">Google News</a>, but it lacks the reporting and analysis element which WT.Social can fill quite nicely.</p>
      <p>While Wikipedia has done a fabulous job providing a comprehensive online encyclopedia, my hope is that WT.Social won’t structure their service in a similar way. I hope it looks, feels, and operates like a Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram – so it becomes a stream of high quality, easy to consume news, where you can dig deeper and get all sides of the story.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Similarly, for the network to work, people will need to be able to share content and news easily. This is where I am curious to see how it works: it is one thing to post a picture of your salad on Facebook, but sharing insightful, nuanced news stories is very different. If WT.Social can crack simple publication of content in a way that is focused on quality, this will be a huge hurdle they will have overcome.</p>
      <p>
        <b>4. Simple sharing is essential</b>
      </p>
      <p>While simple publication is key, so is simple sharing. One of the reasons why social media networks succeed is because sharing material is a simple way to publish to your network.</p>
      <p>Conversely, businesses love this because re-shared content provides a great way to build an audience: when people can share your potential, you get exposed to audiences beyond your immediate followers. This is often how things go viral: extensive sharing builds common experiences across different groups of people.</p>
      <p>WT.Social can’t operate in a silo. People need to be easily able to share great news on WT.Social via email, social media networks, on their websites, and beyond. This will pull people into WT.Social. This is going to be key to their success. If the general public see a regular stream of high quality news on WT.Social linked from their existing social media networks, this will pull them into WT.Social and build both brand and product recognition.</p>
      <p>
        <b>5. Great content and moderation requires a special set of skills</b>
      </p>
      <p>My biggest question for WT.Social is both their biggest risk and biggest opportunity.</p>
      <p>It seems that the core approach for WT.Social is that a community of moderators will collaborate together on news content. Done well, this could mean that a broad range of news, analysis, and fact-checking could be infused into the platform. This doesn’t have to be perfect, but it needs to be better than what we have today (which is frankly, quite a low bar.)</p>
      <p>Here’s the tricky thing though: effective moderation of content and communities is <i>complex, niche work</i>. It requires specialist experience and skills. For WT.Social to truly scale to broader social media growth, they will need to figure out how to do this work en-masse.</p>
      <p>For example, while Wikipedia has an impressive number of editors, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedians">usually around 150k each month</a>, Wikipedia’s readership is huge, averaging at around <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/01/14/wikipedia-at-15/#:~:targetText=Wikipedia%20averages%20more%20than%2018,to%20data%20reported%20by%20Wikipedia.">18 billion page views a month</a>. Social media is far larger. I am curious to see how WT.Social approaches this education challenge.</p>
      <h3>Stay Tuned</h3>
      <p>I am excited to see what WT.Social come up with. They are seeking to solve a difficult, but critically important challenge in how we source, analyze, and share news. While they have some challenges to overcome, I have little doubt that the WT.Social team are some of the smartest in the businesses. I am excited to see their plans unfold.</p>
      <p>Best of luck, WT.Social!</p>
