      <h1>Browns’ Richardson feels Steelers QB deserved punishment</h1>

      <p>BEREA, Ohio (AP) - Browns defensive tackle <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sheldon-richardson/">Sheldon Richardson</a> believes Steelers quarterback <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mason-rudolph/">Mason Rudolph</a> deserved to be punished for his role in Myles Garrett striking him with a helmet.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/garrett/">Garrett</a> was suspended indefinitely by the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a> for his violent actions and he’ll have his appeal heard Wednesday. As the Browns returned to practice Monday without their best defensive player, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sheldon-richardson/">Richardson</a> said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mason-rudolph/">Rudolph</a> should have been disciplined for grabbing Garrett’s face mask and scratching him.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sheldon-richardson/">Richardson</a> didn’t condone his teammate’s behavior. However, he said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mason-rudolph/">Rudolph</a> “can’t antagonize a fight and then claim bullying. … you get what’s coming to you. He was protecting himself. I don’t blame him. Guy keeps rushing me, even with the helmet off, he’s asking for it. Just leave it at that.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sheldon-richardson/">Richardson</a> believes <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/garrett/">Garrett</a> “has a leg to stand on” with his appeal.</p>
      <p>Browns coach Freddie Kitchens said the team will continue to support Garrett, who “had a bad lapse in judgment.”</p>
