      <p>LONG BEACH - Adam Schiff was greeted as a hero at the state party convention in Long Beach over the weekend as he urged California Democrats to help defeat that charlatan in the White House. <br/><br/>Schiff, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, appeared at the convention after leading the opening week of impeachment hearings against President Trump. He was introduced by Rep. Alan Lowenthal, a Democrat from Long Beach, who called Schiff our protector. <br/><br/>The crowd of Democratic delegates and activists gave Schiff a standing ovation that lasted about one minute and 20 seconds. <br/><br/>I feel like I should just stop there, Schiff said. <br/>Schiff then addressed the impeachment hearings, saying our democracy is at risk. <br/><br/>The most grave threat to the life and health of our democracy comes from within  from a president without ethical compass, without understanding of or devotion to our Constitution, Schiff said. There is nothing more dangerous than an unethical president who believes that he is above the law. <br/><br/>Schiff thanked the crowd for its work in electing Democrats in 2018, and urged activists to help send that charlatan in the White House back to the golden throne he came from. <br/><br/>Eight of the top-tier Democratic presidential candidates participated at a Univision forum later in the day. A few of the other presidential candidates addressed the convention on Saturday.</p>
