        <i>This is the new IS.</i>
      </p>
      <p>And, by defiant definition, then, we must conclude, that this is also it.</p>
      <p>Not the old and other it, which was once where it was at, mind you. I mean the new it, the one that was once that, but is always this.</p>
      <p>And what does always really mean, anyway?</p>
      <p>
        <i>Always is a big and important word, and even bigger idea. Have you thought about this yet? Just the idea of always should leaving your scratching your head, as you scrape along the edges of the universe looking for the answers.</i>
      </p>
      <p>We all do that. Always.</p>
      <p>Only some of us admit it. It takes a certain kind of bravery to admit you have no ideas or answers.</p>
      <p>And in the new reality, of digits and dialogue, your dreams are your fact checking interns, nudging you to understand that you’ve under-estimated the undercurrents of your true self, the one that you can always recognize in the mirror world of your unconscious hours.</p>
      <p>And you may have heard, in other news, that it is what it is. Which of course is a re-dux, a rendered re-capitulation of re-calibrated isms in the name of a higher pow wow.</p>
      <p>But that’s what we all seek, in the new algorithm of change.</p>
      <p>The purpose and patterns of life don’t always jive, but then they do, the jazz is at the perfect pitch of personal power.</p>
      <p>I mean, you can’t right this stuff. And we all know you that you can’t write, if you can’t relate, and you can’t relate if you don’t count in the first place.</p>
      <p>And that’s what I think Einstein was getting at when he brought your whole family tree into the equation of everything.</p>
      <p>It’s all relative, in this reality, and you are the one who makes the realization. One data point at a time.</p>
      <p>
        <i>I know the irony is deafening, but the weight of insight always seems heavier in the looking back.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Let’s keep this positive.</p>
      <p>Negativity only gets you closer to absolute zero. We need to fly higher.</p>
      <p>I mean, I am here, and so are you, and in the now, and to speak to you about everything you need to know about the new truth, the truer truth, the one that often escapes you, but never forsakes you, and can awake you, in the utterance of divine thoughts and derived interventions.</p>
      <p>You get the picture.</p>
      <p>You drew it in the first place.</p>
      <p>And now, it is drawing you back, some storied relic from a past shadow of your immortal tour of the unfinished universe, tossing and turning your way through the way home, realizing the home is where your head is at, and right now, that’s anybody’s ball game.</p>
      <p>What is the score anyway?</p>
      <p>Anyway, it doesn’t really matter. It is what it is.</p>
