      <h1>Injury Update For Stretchered-Off Bengals WR Auden Tate</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:26:43+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 00:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>The Cincinnati Bengals are trying to claw their way back into their current game against the Oakland Raiders. Unfortunately, it looks like they’ll have to do so without the services of second-year wideout Auden Tate.</p>
      <p>The former Florida State wide receiver had to be carted off the field following a vicious hit from a Raiders defender. On the play in question, Tate caught a pass while falling down, but was hit immediately and in a very awkward position on his neck.</p>
      <p>Tate stayed down on the ground for several minutes before being carefully placed onto a spine board and taken off.</p>
      <p>Former NFL doctor David J. Chao noted that the team brought out the spine board to get Tate off the field. He suggested that the intensity of the hit could have resulted in a potential cervical fracture in the neck.</p>

      <p>As for the play in question, the Raiders were not flagged for targeting or unnecessary roughness despite the Bengals’ protests.</p>
      <p>The former seventh round pick out of FSU has been in the midst of a breakout campaign. He is currently second on the team in receptions, yards per catch and receiving yards.</p>
      <p>Losing Auden Tate for any period of time is the last thing the winless Bengals need right now.</p>
      <p>Get well soon, Auden.</p>
