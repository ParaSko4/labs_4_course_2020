      <h1>Disney+ Talking To Telco’s Claims AFR In Old News Story</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.channelnews.com.au/author/dwr/" target="_blank">David Richards</a></address>
      <p>Disney+ management is talking to carriers Optus and Telstra about a tie up for their new streaming service launching this week claims the Australian Financial Review.</p>
      <p>It took a junket to The Walt Disney Company for the AFR Marketing writer Max Mason To find out what ChannelNews told readers about back in August 2019.</p>
      <p>He claims that the Walt Disney organisation held talks with Australian telecommunications providers, including Optus and Telstra, to offer new streaming service Disney+ free to its customers as a tool to drive telco subscriber additions.</p>
      <p>We broke this story three months ago.</p>

      <p>Disney Australia and New Zealand managing director Kylie Watson-Wheeler confirmed the US entertainment giant is having a number of discussions with local players but would not be drawn on who it was talking to and what plans they might action.</p>
      <p>“We’re certainly having a variety of conversations across multiple areas. But our plan is to launch standalone first. We want to establish the platform first on its own,” she said.</p>
      <p>Sources said there had been talks since it became clear Disney+ would be launching in Australia, although no agreement was reached. However, following Disney’s deal with Verizon in the US in October, giving customers 12 months free Disney+, there had been renewed interest, though they cautioned it was early days.</p>
      <p>Any deal would likely operate in a similar vein to the way local telcos, such as Optus, paid Netflix to be able to offer its customers the service for free when it launched in Australia in 2015.</p>
      <p>In the US last week, Disney+ signed up 10 million subscribers in its first day with tens of thousands tipped to sign up in Australia this week.</p>
      <p>Disney is set to deliver content from the five brands Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic.</p>
      <p>Australia will become the fourth market to get Disney+ as part of the US giant’s global rollout.</p>
      <p>“The reason we have been selected to be one of the first post the US is really it comes down to the strength of our brands in this market, both Australia and New Zealand, and the deep relationship with consumers we’ve built here,” Ms Watson-Wheeler told the AFR.</p>
      <p>“It’s a really strong market for all four of our core brands – Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars.”</p>
