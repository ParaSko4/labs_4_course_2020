      <p>The 49ers trailed 16-0 early. They trailed 26-23 with seconds remaining.</p>
      <p>They won 36-26.</p>
      <p>Running back <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/13578/jeff-wilson">Jeff Wilson</a> scored on a 25-yard pass from <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/9360/jimmy-garoppolo">Jimmy Garoppolo</a> with 31 seconds remaining. It was the fifth lead change of the second half.</p>
      <p>Garoppolo, who threw for 317 yards and a career-best four touchdowns two weeks ago against the Cardinals, had a career day with 424 yards, four touchdowns and two interceptions.</p>
      <p>A sixth lead change was not in the cards as Arizona receiver <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/14195/keesean-johnson">KeeSean Johnson</a> fumbled with 25 seconds remaining. Defensive lineman Damontre Moore, who signed with the 49ers this week, forced the fumble and <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/10476/jaquiski-tartt">Jaquiski Tartt</a> recovered.</p>
      <p>The Cardinals got two plays to end the game, and it resulted in cherry on top of the 49ers’ victory. <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/13259/dj-reed">D.J. Reed</a> Jr. scooped up the loose ball, as the Cardinals tried to lateral their way to a win, and scored on a 4-yard return.</p>
      <p>The last time the 49ers rallied from a deficit of 16 points or more in the regular season was Oct. 2, 2011, when they were down 23-3 to the Eagles before winning 24-23, according to Josh Dubow of the Associated Press.</p>
      <p>The 49ers overcame a 17-0 deficit against the Falcons in the NFC Championship Game on Jan. 20, 2013.</p>
      <p>The 49ers avoided a two-game losing streak in moving to 9-1, maintaining their lead over the Seahawks in the NFC West. The Cardinals fell to 3-7-1.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/13950/kyler-murray">Kyler Murray</a> passed for 146 yards and two touchdowns and ran for 67.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/10404/david-johnson">David Johnson</a> played seven snaps in the first half, according to Josh Weinfuss of ESPN, none in the second half and did not get a touch. <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/11263/kenyan-drake">Kenyan Drake</a> had 67 rushing yards and 13 receiving yards.</p>
