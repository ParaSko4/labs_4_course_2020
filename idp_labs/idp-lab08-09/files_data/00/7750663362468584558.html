      <p>The midfielder has often invested in projects in his homeland, including the construction of a new playing field in his home municipality of Ub.</p>
      <p>Mourinho, who was <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/sack-race/news/jose-mourinho-leaves-manchester-united_344532.html">removed from his position</a> at Old Trafford in December 2018, signed Matic as both Chelsea and United manager in 2014 and 2017 respectively.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Telegraf</i>, the new 500-seater facility will be named after the 56-year-old due to his 'attitude of full respect for Serbia'.</p>
      <p>In a recorded message sent to the people of Ub in response to the gesture, Mourinho said: "Hi, I'm Jose.</p>
      <p>"Ub is a special city with lots of special people who deserve a special football pitch. I am really happy and proud to know how well things are going and that our 'special one' pitch is almost ready for everyone in Ub to enjoy. Bye and I'll speak to you soon."</p>
      <p>The Portuguese boss has been linked with taking over as manager at Real Madrid and Tottenham Hotspur.</p>
