      <h1>HDFC charges man for credit card he never had</h1>

      <p><i>By Hetal Vyas Thaker<br/></i><br/>A consumer court in Bengaluru recently lambasted one of the topmost private Banks for wrongly debiting over Rs1 lakh from a customer’s savings account towards credit card charges, which had a maximum limit of only Rs50,000. The 3rd Additional Bangalore Urban District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum has now asked the Bank along with its branch Manager and the Manager, HDFC Cards Division, Chennai to jointly or severally together refund entire amount of Rs1.14 lakh to complainant H Manjunatha Shetty, along with 15 per cent interest. The Bank has also been ordered to pay Rs40,000 as compensation towards causing mental agony and Rs5,000 as cost of litigation. <br/><br/>H Manjunath Shetty, 31, a resident of Chikka Banaswadi and a private sector employee had opened a savings account with the HDFC Bank’s Outer Ring Road Branch in 2016. Shetty also obtained a credit card from the Bank with a maximum limit of Rs50,000. <br/><br/>In his complaint Shetty said that the Bank wrongly debited Rs1,14,000 from his account via credit card payment on January 1, 2017 for payment of a hotel bill in two installments of Rs14,000 and Rs1 lakh. In his written complainant filed he also pointed out that he was wrongly charged for a credit card which did not belong to him (his card had a different number). <br/><br/>When he noticed the said transaction on January 8, 2017 in his credit card statement, Shetty followed up with the Bank authorities but did not receive any positive response. <br/><br/>Shetty, in a follow up of his complaints with the Bank issued a legal notice to the concerned authorities on August 19, 2017 and sought refund of Rs1.14 lakh. But, shockingly a statement issued by the Bank on September 2, 2017 towards his Account showed a negative balance of Rs1,61,783. He then moved the 3rd Additional Consumer Court, Bangalore stating that “he has been in severe trouble and has suffered by such vexatious act of the Bank.”</p>
      <p>If a credit card holder can use his credit card and transact even beyond his credit limit, the prescribed limit will have no significance at all­</p>
      <p>–Consumer Court<br/><br/>In its defence, the Bank argued that the complainant had agreed to abide by the terms and conditions of the MITC Form, while obtaining a credit card from the Bank in 2016. The Bank also pointed out that Shetty was informed about the said transaction immediately by the Bank via message alerts and he continued to utilize the card but failed to pay the total dues. “Owing to the non-receipt of the said payable amount the Bank exercised its power placing the available funds in the account on ‘Hold’ and issued a notice to pay the outstanding amount in 7 days,” argued the Bank. <br/><br/>In their judgment dated October 21, 2019, a bench of President Venkatasudarshan DR And Member L Mamatha said that one aspect that needs clarification is when the credit card has the outer limit of Rs50,000 only, how could the card holder use it that too in a single day and carry out transaction of Rs1.14 lakh in a hotel. “If a credit card holder can use his credit card and transact even beyond his credit limit, the prescribed limit will have no significance at all. Therefore, it is for the Bank to explain as to how the complainant could use his credit card beyond the limit. But, there is absolutely no evidence placed by the Bank on this aspect. This gives further raise to suspect about the case of the Bank,” noted the judges. <br/><br/><br/>Taking a note of the difference in the card numbers of the credit card owned by Shetty and the card number mentioned by the Bank in the transaction, the judges said that “from all this it is clear that the complainant has not at all used his credit card. Having committed such a gross mistake or error, the Bank has unnecessarily burdened the complainant with a heavy amount of Rs1.14 lakh. This in our view certainly amounts to a serious short coming or inadequacy of performance by the Bank. The complainant has been deprived of making use of his hard earned money since January 1, 2017 and the Bank is getting enriched at the cost of the complainant.”</p>
