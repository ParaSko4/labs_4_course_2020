      <h1>SiCK Mechanical Keyboard Is 3D Printed</h1>

      <p>We’ve noticed a rash of builds of [ FedorSosnin’s] do-it-yourself 3D-printed mechanical keyboard, <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3478494/makes">SiCK-68</a> lately. The cost is pretty low — SiCK stands for Super, Inexpensive, Cheap, Keyboard. According to the <a href="https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/9c/58/5b/49/69/SiCK-68_Cost_Breakdown.pdf">bill of materials</a>, the original cost about $50. Of course, that doesn’t include the cost of the 3D printer and soldering gear, but who doesn’t have all that already?</p>
      <p>The brains behind this is a Teensy that scans the hand-wired key matrix. So the only electronics here are the switches, each with a companion diode, and the Teensy. The <a href="https://github.com/dhowland/EasyAVR">EasyAVR</a> software does all the logical work both as firmware and a configuration GUI.</p>
      <p>If you look at the many different builds, each has its own character. Yet they look overwhelmingly professional — like something you might buy at a store. This is the kind of project that would have been extremely difficult to pull off a decade ago. You could build the keyboard, of course, but making it look like a finished product was beyond most of us unless we were willing to make enough copies to justify having special tooling made to mold the cases.</p>
      <p>PCBs are cheap now and we might be tempted to use one here. There are quite a few methods for using a 3D printer to create a board, so that would be another option. The hand wiring seems like it would be a drag, although manageable. If you need wiring <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/09/27/the-zen-of-mechanical-keyboard-wiring/">inspiration</a>, we can help.</p>
