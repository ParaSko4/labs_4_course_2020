      <p>A school bus with about three dozen students on board slid off an icy road and rolled onto its side Monday morning, but there were no serious injuries.</p>
      <p>Police, emergency crews, school employees and members of the public responded quickly to help unload everyone after the accident about six kilometres north of Stony Plain, Alta., west of Edmonton.</p>
      <p>“The bus was stopped to load a student,” Brian Hauptman, general manager of Golden Arrow School Buses, told CTV News.</p>
      <p>“The student loaded, and then the driver pulled away from that stop. She took her foot off the brake and put it in neutral. The bus just kept sliding at a slow, slow speed. Unfortunately, because the ditch was so steep, you could see it ... slowly go over on its side.”</p>
      <p>Early information indicated the 34 students, ranging from kids in kindergarten to high school, were from the Evergreen Catholic Separate School and Parkland County School divisions.</p>
      <p>Amy Quintal’s 11-year-old son, Brock, was one of the students on the bus. She said she had just dropped Brock off when she received a call from his aide. Brock is non-verbal and uses a wheelchair.</p>
      <p>“Said a little prayer (and) went on my way to get him. It could have been much worse,” Quintal told CTV.</p>
      <p>She said Brock was already off the bus by the time she arrived.</p>
      <p>“They had already gotten all the students off safely.”</p>
      <p>Brock’s chair is secured in the bus with four straps. He also wears a transportation belt. Quintal said he wasn’t hurt at all.</p>
      <p>“I’m just thankful that the community came together.”</p>
      <p>Students on the bus were being transported to several schools in the area, including Muir Lake School in Stony Plain.</p>
      <p>Parkland School Division said icy road conditions caused the rollover.</p>
