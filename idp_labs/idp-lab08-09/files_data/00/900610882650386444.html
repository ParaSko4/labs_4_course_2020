      <p>Thailand’s leading integrated lifestyle real-estate group, Asset World Corporation (AWC) has signed an agreement with Marriott International to open three properties in the southeast Asian country between 2020 and 2024.</p>
      <p>The hotels include Courtyard by Marriott, a 248-room property slated to open in late 2020 in Phuket; a 900-room Pattaya Marriott Marquis Hotel and a 398-room JW Marriott The Pattaya Beach Resort and Spa.</p>
      <p>Wallapa Traisorat, CEO and president of Asset World Corp Public Company (AWC) said, “We are greatly delighted to strengthen our relationship with Marriott International, the prominent global hospitality operator that ensures the highest standards of hospitality in line with our values.”</p>
      <p>He added, “We expect the hotels to benefit from Marriott International’s powerful global distribution platform, innovative sales and marketing programming, and industry-leading experience. In addition, the scale of its loyalty programme – Marriott Bonvoy – is pivotal to attracting travellers.”</p>
      <p>Wallapa added. “Our collaboration with Marriott International will help us set a new hospitality benchmark in Pattaya and Phuket – two highly dynamic cities now emerging as ideal destinations for both leisure and MICE tourism, with endless opportunities from a constant inflow of business and leisure travellers.”</p>
      <p>Both in Pattaya town, Pattaya Marriott Marquis Hotel and JW Marriott The Pattaya Beach Resort and Spa together will offer 11 food and beverage outlets; and approximately 10,000 sq m of the convention, event and meeting spaces.</p>
      <p>Craig S. Smith, group president, Marriott International Asia Pacific said, “We look forward to building on our long-standing relationship with Asset World Corporation with this landmark multi-agreement signing for three new hotels in Pattaya and Phuket. Sharing similar values of attaining the highest standards in hospitality, Marriott International is proud to play a strategic role in AWC’s vision of expanding its diverse portfolio of hospitality and lifestyle projects in Thailand and beyond.”</p>
      <p>Currently, Asset World Corporation is one of the largest owners of Marriott International properties in the Asia Pacific (excluding China) with more than 4,200 rooms across Thailand.</p>
