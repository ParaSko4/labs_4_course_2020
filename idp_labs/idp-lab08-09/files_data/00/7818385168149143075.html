      <p>Israeli satellite operator Space Communication Ltd. (Spacecom) announced Monday that its newest satellite, AMOS-17, has successfully completed systems testing and reached its designated orbit point in space. AMOS-17’s predecessor, AMOS-6, exploded on a SpaceX launchpad in August 2016. AMOS-17, intended to provide communication services primarily to Africa, was built to replace it.</p>
      <p>The accident cost Spacecom hundreds of millions of dollars in lost contracts, including a high-profile $95 million deal with Facebook and a $285 million acquisition deal with Shanghai-listed telecommunication technologies supplier Beijing Xinwei Technology Group Ltd. In July, the company’s CEO at the time David Pollak said <a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3767211,00.html">the company was in talks </a>with an Africa-based client “comparable to Facebook” to provide communication services using its new AMOS-17 satellite. Pollak <a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3772851,00.html">stepped down</a> in late October after a 24-year tenure.</p>

      <p>AMOS-17 was <a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3767840,00.html">launched </a>in August from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on the back of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. It is scheduled to begin its commercial operations in the coming days after stabilization, Spacecom said.</p>
      <p>AMOS-17 brings the number of Spacecom’s currently operational satellites to four, following AMOS-3, AMOS-4, and AMOS-7.</p>
      <p>Spacecom was spun off government-owned Israel Aerospace Industries Ltd. (IAI) in 1993, with the goal of marketing AMOS-1, the first Israeli-made satellite. The company went public in 2005.</p>
