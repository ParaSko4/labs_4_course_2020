        <b>The Germany coach thinks Spain are more likely than Germany to win the Euros next summer.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The German coach, Joachim Low, considers that<b> there are at least six European sides</b>, among them Spain, who are currently above Germany, so <b>he does not see his team as favourites</b> to win the Euros. </p>
      <p>"Teams like <b>England, France, Spain, Italy, Belgium and Holland</b> are better than us. They have already been through the transition period between generations. <b>I don't see us as favourites to win the Euros,</b>" Low said prior to Tuesday's encounter with Northern Ireland. </p>
      <p>Low, however, praised his team who have already secured qualificatio<b>n and can secure first place with a win</b> on Tuesday. </p>

      <p>"I want to congratulate my players. <b>We had to make quite a few changes </b>as more than ten people got injured. Despite that, we qualified anyway," Low said. </p>
      <p>After the failure at the last World Cup when the then defending champions were eliminated in the group stages, <b>Low announced various changes to the squad</b>. Several World Cup winners like <b>Mats Hummels, Jerome Boateng and Thomas Muller </b>were no longer selected. </p>
