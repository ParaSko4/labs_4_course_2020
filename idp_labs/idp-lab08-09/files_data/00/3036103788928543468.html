      <h1>SAA is the worst airline in South Africa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/staff-writer" target="_blank">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>The latest South African Customer Satisfaction Index (SA-csi) for Airlines conducted by Consulta reveals that FlySafair has the highest ranking while SAA has the worst ranking.</p>
      <p>The SA-csi for Airlines offers insights into local airlines by measuring customers’ overall satisfaction.</p>
      <p>It also includes, among other measures, a Customer Expectations Index, a Perceived Quality Index, and a Perceived Value Index.</p>
      <p>The sample included 1,025 customers of the five biggest airlines, who were randomly selected to participate in the survey.</p>
      <h3>Domestic airline rankings</h3>
      <p>The SA-csi polled customers of British Airways (Comair), FlySafair, Kulula, Mango, and South African Airways (SAA).</p>
      <p>FlySafair leads the SA-csi ranking, with 78 points out of 100, followed by British Airways which scored 75.7, while Kulula reached 74.4 – all in leader positions.</p>
      <p>Mango scored on par with the industry average of 74 points. SAA lagged behind with 68.8 and well below the industry average of 72.4.</p>
      <p>“FlySafair’s performance has been particularly robust, driven by a focus on customer service and on-time departures and arrivals,” said SA-csi founder Adré Schreuder.</p>
      <p>“According to statistics published by the Airport Company South Africa, FlySafair scored an average on-time performance of 93.6% for 2018, well ahead of other local airlines.”</p>
      <p>He said FlySafair was able to balance being a low-cost airline without sacrificing customer service.</p>
      <h3>SAA not meeting expectations</h3>
      <p>The research shows that SAA has an Expectation-Quality gap of -0.9, which means that customer expectations are not being met in terms of perceived quality.</p>
      <p>SAA also had the worst Price-Quality gap of all airlines, which means that people do not feel the price they pay is fair when looking at the quality provided.</p>
      <p>SAA also finished last in perceived value and perceived quality – and had the highest incidence of complaints.</p>
      <p>“When you consider half of SAA complaints are not handled to a satisfactory level for customers, this will have a very direct and negative impact on overall customer satisfaction, and in turn loyalty,” Schreuder said.</p>
