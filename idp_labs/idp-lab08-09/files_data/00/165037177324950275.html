        <b>Ciro Immobile and Nicolo Zaniolo scored a brace each as Italy wrapped up their perfect Euro 2020 qualifying campaign with a crushing 9-1 win over Armenia in Palermo on Monday.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Already-qualified Italy</b> registered an <b>11th straight win under coach Roberto Mancini</b>, as the four-time world champions showed they were <b>back on track </b>after failing to qualify for last year's World Cup for the first time since <b>1958.</b></p>
      <p>Mancini's side have <b>won all 10 of their Group J matches </b>and are assured of a seeding in the Euro 2020 draw on November 30.</p>
      <p><b>Immobile </b>started the goal-spree on eight minutes in <b>Sicily, </b>adding <b>a second in the 33rd minute.</b></p>
      <p>Roma midfielder <b>Zaniolo scored his first goal for the national sid</b>e on nine minutes, completing <b>a brace on 64 minutes.</b></p>

      <p><b>Nicolo Barella</b> also scored in the first half.</p>
      <p><b>Alessio Romagnoli</b>, <b>Jorginho</b>'s 75th-minute penalty, and goals from<b> Riccardo Orsolini and Federico Chiesa</b> concluded the hammering.</p>
      <p><b>Edgar Babayan</b> pulled a goal back for <b>Armenia</b> 10 minutes from time in a rout which could have been heavier with the Azzurri rattling the woodwork on multiple occasions.</p>
      <p>This was not quite either Italy's biggest international score or their largest margin of victory.</p>
      <p>They <b>beat Egypt 11-3 in the bronze-medal match at the 1928 Olympics</b> in Amsterdam and the USA 9-0 at Brentford in the first round at the 1948 Olympics. In 1920, they <b>beat France 9-4 in a friendly.</b></p>
