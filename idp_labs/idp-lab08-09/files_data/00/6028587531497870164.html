      <p>It's 4 p.m. on a Tuesday afternoon in the Plaza Workspace, an open and airy environment set under a soaring glass atrium in the Ravinia neighborhood of Atlanta. A group of coworkers are meeting in the Nook, a sound-buffering pod with an interactive flat-screen TV. Nearby, a pair of entrepreneurs are talking business over craft cocktails in a Huddle Spot, a mid-century-modern-inspired space with a high-top table and an iPad for ordering from the nearby bar. Around the corner is the Studio—which looks more like a cool Soho loft than a meeting room and can be rented by the hour. Downstairs in a sleek lounge area, a company is snacking on farm-to-table bites during a break-out session from a conference.Scenes from the latest, hottest coworking hub in Atlanta? No—just another work day at the <a href="https://www.cpravinia.com/">Crowne Plaza Atlanta Perimeter at Ravinia</a>, which is ground zero for Crowne Plaza’s push to reinvent itself as the go-to hotel brand for the modern business traveler. Over the last few years, the company has been renovating its properties by combining form and function with stylish new boutique-inspired design schemes as well as adaptive lobbies with plenty of coworking areas and convenient charging outlets everywhere you look.</p>
      <p>“We’re a large, multinational corporation, but we also value the local business person and the entrepreneur,” says Meredith Latham, VP of Crowne Plaza, Americas. “We see this as an opportunity to help businesses thrive.”</p>

      <p>Besides doubling as one of Atlanta’s coolest coworking spaces, this hotel is also about to host the launch of an exciting development in the evolution of the Crowne Plaza brand: a partnership with the <a href="https://www.genglobal.org/">Global Entrepreneurship Network (GEN)</a>, a non-profit organization that is on a mission to make it possible for anyone, anywhere, to start and scale a new venture. The news is being announced—fittingly—during the annual <a href="https://www.genglobal.org/gew">Global Entrepreneurship Week</a> that kicks off on November 18 and includes 40,000 events with 10 million participants in more than 170 countries.</p>
      <p>The idea is that Crowne Plaza will be GEN’s exclusive hospitality sponsor and the new global home of the group’s <a href="https://www.genglobal.org/startup-huddle">StartUp Huddle</a> program, which is designed to help entrepreneurs collaborate, problem solve and inspire one another. “Sort of like going to church for startups, Startup Huddle is a series of weekly (or in some cases monthly) meetings to support one entrepreneur at a time,” says Jonathan Ortmans, president and founder of GEN. The GEN network will be able to tap into Crowne Plaza’s 400-plus locations worldwide as well as its new Plaza Workspace coworking and meeting<b> </b>spaces.  </p>
      <p>“We knew we wanted to get together with an organization that was empowering people to do great work. GEN stood out because of the global nature of the programming and because they’re enabling entrepreneurs to do great work,” says Latham.</p>

      <p>Ortmans says that GEN was in turn attracted to Crowne Plaza because of its innovative approach to hospitality. “We all stay in hotels but tend to view them as the exclusive domain of travelers rather than as community hubs where you can find local engagement. Being a 24/7 part of their community, Crowne Plaza’s notion that they can not only serve but connect the local innovator community as well as the business traveler appealed to us,” says Ortmans. “It is the first hospitality company we are aware of that has come to understand the power of entrepreneurs and the communities that serve them.”</p>
      <p>Indeed, that was the point, says Latham: “By our support of small business and entrepreneurs through the GEN network, we’re able to have a greater purpose.”</p>
      <p>Crowne Plaza’s new approach is completely on trend in a world where work and personal lives are blending more than ever—and it goes back to the brand’s roots, which are deeply entrenched in the business space. After spotting a need for a hotel that catered to road warriors, the founders of Holiday Inn decided to launch Crowne Plaza in 1983, which created a more premium brand aimed at business travelers. “Groups, meetings and events are the core of our business,” says Latham. In 1990, the InterContinental Hotels Group purchased Holiday Inn’s family of hotels, including Crowne Plaza.</p>
      <p>Three years ago, Crowne Plaza kicked off the $200 million Accelerate Program to create design-led and technology-enabled solutions to enhance the experience of the modern business traveler. “It's not the traveler from 1983,” says Latham. “Gone are the days of briefcases and agendas and super corporate board meetings. Business travel is done very differently today and technology is at the core of our evolution.”</p>

      <p>Besides the innovative, contemporary new lobbies, guest rooms are getting an update with a signature space called the <a href="https://www.travelpulse.com/news/hotels-and-resorts/crowne-plaza-hotels-resorts-awarded-patent-for-worklife-room.html">WorkLife Room</a>—which combines living and working. “It’s the only patented hotel room system where the bed is on an angle and all of the lighting is on the wall, so the countertops are clear,” says Latham. You’ll also find 17 points of power throughout the room (ie. no lack of outlets) and smart furniture like a sofa that functions as a workspace. “Those are the little things that make a big difference to the business traveler,” says Latham.</p>
      <p>The company is also working to improve how guests sleep with an innovative program called Sleep Advantage. This includes everything from better bed linens and pillows to products that vary from market to market, helping guests relieve stress and rest more soundly. In Paris, you’ll find sleep milk, while Asia provides calming tea. In the U.S, there’s a Sleep Advantage kit with soothing face wipes and a lavender spray from <a href="https://cphotelseattle.com/beekman-products/">Beekman 1802</a>, an artisanal company that makes all of Crowne Plaza’s amenities.</p>

      <p>Food and beverage programming has gone under the knife, too. Crowne Plaza worked with its sister brand Kimpton—a cutting-edge boutique hotel company—to rethink its culinary concepts. Another critical part of creating a new guest experience included a reimagining of staff uniforms. <a href="https://www.ahotellife.com/timo-weiland-crowne-plaza/">Fashion designer Timo Weiland</a> and his team developed a forward-thinking collection of uniforms with a mid-century-modern feel that aligned with Crowne Plaza’s new design ethos.</p>
      <p>Ortmans says that in addition to Crowne Plaza’s community involvement and focus on collaboration—which was “fully aligned” with GEN’s mission around the world—the group was impressed with the hotel company’s innovative environments. “Increasingly, research has shown that entrepreneurs thrive better in an open, transparent community culture that embraces collaboration and concepts like design thinking,” says Ortmans. </p>
      <p>“This is the hospitality industry and we’re here to help people have a great stay,” says Latham. “We may as well help people develop great businesses, as well.”</p>
