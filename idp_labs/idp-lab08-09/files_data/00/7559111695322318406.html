      <p><b>REVIEW</b> – Since I started gaming, I have been using a headset with a microphone attached. The headsets themselves were not cheap so I figured the microphones would be enough, yet, when I see streamers, the have a dedicated microphone. Eventually, curiosity got the better of me, so I checked out the Blue Yeti X professional USB microphone. It’s a brand I’ve seen streamers using, so I figured it should be good. Let’s see if that’s the case.</p>

      <h3>Design and features</h3>
      <p>The Yeti X is plug and play, so I just plugged it into my PC and started with that. It worked like a charm. I did notice that they used a Micro-USB cable, which surprised me since it’s almost 2020 and USB-C is becoming standard. After trying the plug and play settings out, I installed the Blue Voice software, which for me was simple due to having the G Hub software installed on my PC already. After that, I went into the settings and started tinkering.</p>

      <p>Initially, I had my PC on my desk because ‘it looked cool’ and I wanted to show off the RGB lighting. The mic picked up the vibrations from the fans, however, so I had to move it to the floor. In the future, I may pick up a boom arm in order to put my PC back on the desk.</p>
      <p>Once I got the PC situation sorted out, I hopped in and started playing some games. A few folks commented and asked if I had a new microphone (in a positive way) and it was nice to no longer have a microphone attached to my headphones.</p>

      <p>To switch between the settings, you just hold down the button on the dial until it switches to the desired setting. First, I set the mic gain, and noticed right away that it did not need to be very high at all. Between 2-3 dots was all that was necessary to be heard and not overblown. Next, since I plugged my headphones into the microphone, I adjusted the volume settings. With the headphones plugged in, I cannot use the PC or keyboard to control volume (except mute) anymore; only the microphone dial works. Lastly, I made it so I could just barely hear myself on the microphone for the direct monitoring setting.</p>

      <p>On the back of the mic, there is a button to go between the four polar patterns. (Aka: mic directional settings) I kept my settings on Cardioid, which was forward facing, the entire time. My friend mentioned as I went through each preset that he could hear the difference, especially when the setting was set to either Omni or Stereo modes.</p>

      <p>After trying out the plug and play model for a week with positive results, I switched over to using the Blue Voice software, and I noticed right away that my voice seemed either really loud or really quiet. My friend commented that I had a bizarre ‘in and out’ sound as if the microphone suddenly picked up I was talking and amplified it.. on every word. After testing and fiddling around, I figured out that the software was best when you keep the microphone less than 1 ft from your mouth. Once I figured that out, it sounded very, very good.</p>

      <p>I preferred to use presets, and the one I settled on using was either ‘Classic Radio Voice’ or ‘Broadcaster 2’ for everyday use. I still need to fiddle more with the customization, but the presets are really nice to have. Initially, I was very nervous about how much I was going to have to tweak the Yeti X in order to get it to keep my background noise out. I had heard it took quite a bit of work. I am unsure whether I have a very soundproof room (which I doubt) or the Blue Voice software, but it was pretty easy to get things set up how I wanted. Tweaking presets worked just fine. The only thing I could hear was my typing, and that’s because the microphone is right behind the (loud) keyboard for the time being.</p>

      <p>You can also customize the Yeti X’s RGB lighting on the Blue Voice software and set an equalizer if you are using the mic pass-through for your headphones. I am still yet unsure if I will go back to using the mini-amp my headphones come with, or continue using the Yeti X pass-through. For now, I’ll keep it as is.</p>

      <p>I used a couple of different headsets, both wireless and wired, and they all worked seamlessly with the Blue Yeti X. It did not like it when I kept the microphone attached to the headset, though outside of testing purposes, you wouldn’t really use both at the same time so I didn’t find that to be an issue.</p>
      <p>Since I am not a singer, I tested the Yeti X out on my stream, and using StreamLabs and Twitch, it sounded good. <a href="https://clips.twitch.tv/DrabPluckyCougarWow">Here’s a clip of me testing the microphone out on stream.</a> To me, the sound is clear, and those who have heard my voice in person say that it sounds ‘just like me’ where before, with my previous headset microphone, there was a noticeable difference.</p>
      <h3>What I like</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Plug and play</li>
        <li>Excellent sound quality</li>
        <li>Headphone pass through</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What I’d change</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Micro-USB should be USB-C</li>
        <li>Blue Voice software can sound weird if too far away</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
      <p>Overall, I definitely figured out the appeal to having a dedicated, stand-alone microphone. I felt everyone could hear me very well when playing both multiplayer games and when streaming. The ease at which I could plug and play with the Blue Yeti X microphone really appealed to me, but the ability to get so much more out of the Yeti X with the Blue Voice software is also such a great pairing. If you are someone wanting excellent quality in a microphone and the ability to customize, the Blue Yeti X is definitely one to look at.</p>
