      <p>PRAGUE (AP) - The Czech government has approved a plan to adopt a tax on internet giants like Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple.</p>
      <p>Joining France and some other countries, the measure would impose a 7% annual tax on companies’ digital business revenues in the Czech Republic. It would apply to companies with global sales worth more than 750 million euros ($830 million) and Czech revenue exceeding 100 million Czech crowns ($4.3 million).</p>
      <p>The finance ministry has estimated the tax could bring in some 5 billion crowns ($216 million) a year, starting in 2020.</p>
      <p>The tax still needs parliamentary approval.</p>

        <p>Monday’s move comes as some 130 countries try to find a way to more fairly tax global internet giants, with the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development leading the project.</p>
