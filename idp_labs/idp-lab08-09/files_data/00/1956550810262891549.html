      <h3>Time Out Says</h3>
      <p>If you’re yet to venture to Al Seef, this winter weather makes it the ideal time to check out the Bur Dubai spot. Despite having loads of dining options, though, Al Seef has been fairly underpopulated, which is a shame as there are some <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/restaurants">top eateries</a> to check out.<br/><br/>Creekside dining is abundant at this cultural hangout, but Skafos, at Zabeel House, has the most enviable position with a huge wrap around terrace that has several jetties jutting out into the water, as well as a floating shisha deck.<br/><br/>We are expecting hearty Greek food – Skafos is a Greek for vessel, which is an indicator of the type of <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/restaurants">cuisine</a> you would think. But a revamp of the menu over the summer means that while moussaka and baklava feature, dishes are influenced by flavours from the wider Med.<br/><br/>The food is top-notch. The white bait are crispy and meaty with just the right amount of batter, while the prawns in garlic and chilli are not the tiny pil pil style prawns we are expecting, but juicy, plump shrimp – pre-peeled, which is always better and far less messy in our book– that have a tasty chargrilled barbecue flavour.<br/><br/>We can’t resist the Greek theme and opt for the moussaka – a vegetarian dish made with chickpeas rather than minced lamb – is light and delicious, and a far-cry from the heavy béchamel sauce variety we are used to, while the seared sea bass is expertly fried, giving it a crispy skin, but retaining the moist flakiness of the fish underneath.<br/><br/>This waterside eatery in Old Dubai gets a thumbs up from us for many reasons, and is the revamped menu is even tastier than its predecessor.<br/><br/>The perfectly executed <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/gallery/410668-50-best-dishes-in-dubai-of-2019">dishes</a>, chilled-out vibe, top views of all the nautical activity on the Creek and friendly service, mean Skafos is an ace all-rounder.<br/><br/>We’d like to use a “get us to the Greek” pun here, but “prepare to be whisked off to the Med” is more fitting. It doesn’t matter though, just do it.<br/><br/><b>WHAT IS IT...</b><br/>Casual Mediterranean spot by the Creek<br/><br/><b>WHY GO...</b><br/>Must-try waterside dining (don’t miss that moussaka)</p>
