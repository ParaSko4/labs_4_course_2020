      <p>Coming off a disappointing draw against an underdog opponent in a World Cup qualifier last week, South Korea will face an even tougher task in a friendly match against Brazil on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The match at Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi will kick off at 5:30 p.m. (local time), or 10:30 p.m. (Seoul time).</p>
      <p>It will be part of the global tour for world No. 3 Brazil, which lost to Argentina 1-0 last week in Saudi Arabia.</p>
      <p>South Korea, ranked 39th, have one victory and four losses against Brazil, the lone win coming in March 1999 in Seoul.</p>

      <p>The most recent showdown came in Seoul in October 2013, when South Korea lost 2-0.</p>
      <p>Neymar, perhaps the biggest Brazilian star today, is not on the team for the tour, as he’s nursing a hamstring injury. But other big names, such as Philippe Coutinho of Bayern Munich, Gabriel Jesus of Manchester City and Roberto Firmino of Liverpool, will make the trip to Abu Dhabi.</p>
      <p>And South Korea will be up against a hungry Brazil team, which has gone five matches without a win, with three draws and two losses.</p>
      <p>Captained by Tottenham Hotspur attacking ace Son Heung-min, South Korea will look to bounce back from a scoreless draw against Lebanon last Thursday in the second round of the Asian qualifying for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.</p>
      <p>The match in Beirut was played behind closed doors for safety reasons amid nationwide anti-government protests in Lebanon. It was the second straight away World Cup qualifying match that South Korea played with no spectators — the first one being in Pyongyang against North Korea on Oct. 15 — and also the Taeguk Warriors’ second straight 0-0 draw.</p>
      <p>Son will once again be looked upon as the key piece to the offense. Though Son has been scoring at a decent pace with the Spurs, he has just two goals in his 11 international matches in 2019.</p>
      <p>At the other end, South Korean defenders will have to step up to keep the Brazilians at bay.</p>
      <p>South Korea have not yet allowed a goal in four matches in the World Cup qualifying campaign. But then again, South Korea have yet to take on a top-10 opponent in 2019, and Colombia, currently No. 10, were in 12th place in the FIFA rankings when South Korea beat them 2-1 in a March friendly.</p>
      <p>After a series of World Cup qualifiers against overmatched Asian opponents, South Korean goalkeepers will finally get to work up a sweat in net.</p>
      <p>All signs point to this being a difficult match for South Korea, to say the least, but forward/attacking midfielder Hwang Hee-chan said he won’t be intimidated against Brazil.</p>
      <p>“They’re the best team in the world, but I am not scared of them,” Hwang said. “We have our own strengths, and we’ll try to capitalize on those.”</p>
