      <p><b>Murphy USA (NYSE: MUSA)</b>, a retail gas station company, saw its stock rally by more than 35% over the last month, driven by stronger than expected Q3 results. While revenues were lower on a year-over-year basis, EPS came significantly ahead of Street estimates (reported $2.18, versus estimates of $1.58 per share). The earnings beat comes on the back of stronger fuel margins as well as increased merchandise margins, which were driven partly by higher tobacco sales. The company’s loyalty program Murphy Drive Rewards, which was launched nationwide earlier this year, is also helping it drive merchandise sales.We ‘step back’ from these recent swings to review Murphy USA’s performance over the last few years, as a context for what might come next.
