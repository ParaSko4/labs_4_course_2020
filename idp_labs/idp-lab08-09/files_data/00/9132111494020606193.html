      <p>The Accra High Court has thrown out a bail application by Senior Police Officer, ACP Dr. Benjamin Agordzor.</p>
      <p>Mr. Agordzor, who is facing trial for his alleged involvement in the plot to destabilize the country, through his lawyers, last week challenged the jurisdiction of the court to hear the case in a bid to have their client freed but failed as the court ruled that it was clothed with jurisdiction to hear the matter.</p>
      <p>Presenting his case in court today, Defense Counsel for the defendant, Martin Kpebu, prayed the court grant his client, who has been in police custody, bail.</p>
      <p>According Lawyer Kpebu, his client is “harmless” adding that the suspect “had no intention” of throwing the country in chaos.</p>
      <p>He maintained that ACP Agordzo’s affiliation to the WhatsApp group was solely on philanthropic basis.</p>
      <p>Presiding judge, Justice George Buadi however refused the application on the basis that, Mr. Agordzor committed wrong in his position as senior officer by affiliating with the alleged suspects to begin with.</p>
      <p>Senor State Attorney, Hilda Craig on her part chastised ACP Agordzo for his role in whopping the sentiments of Ghanaians instead of working to arrest them.</p>
      <p>She also noted that his high-ranking position in the Ghana Police Service might possibly interfere with ongoing investigations if he is granted bail, an assertion which the judge endorsed.</p>
      <p>In the Justice Buadi's words, “Application is premature as investigations are on going”.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the High Court last week dismissed a bail application by the seven accused persons facing trial for their alleged plot to topple the government.</p>
      <p>Justice George Buadi said none of the accused persons had been detained beyond two months and their arrest and detention are not arbitrary or unlawful.</p>
      <p>He further added that the accused persons have the capacity to interfere with investigations if released.</p>
      <p>The Judge cited an example of how Junior Officers managed to stage a coup in the country.</p>
      <p>The nine persons, three civilians, and six military personnel are facing charges of treason felony and conspiracy to commit treason felony.</p>
      <p>The court last week ordered Dr Agordzo to desist from granting media interviews.</p>
      <p>ACP Dr. Benjamin Agordzor has however denied his involvement in an alleged plot to destabilize the state, noting that he is being victimized.</p>
