      <p>Back in March 2017, the City of Stonnington announced plans for the new <a href="https://www.broadsheet.com.au/melbourne/city-file/article/prahran-gets-new-public-plaza">$60 million Prahran Square</a> to replace the 9000-square-metre Cato Street car park. Construction began in January 2018, and now the plaza is set to open on Sunday, December 1.</p>
      <p>Prahran Square will have 10,000 square metres of open green space above the new 500-bay car park that opened in August this year (which increased the number of parking spaces by 20 per cent).</p>
      <p>Coinciding with the opening of the new urban park is the launch of PS Summer Series – a program of music, live performances, street art, and health and wellbeing sessions – that will kick off at 11am. The City of Stonnington Mayor, Councillor Steve Stefanopoulos, will officially open the square at 1pm, followed by a performance by South of the River Choir. The festivities will close that night with the illumination of the festive tree lights.</p>
      <p>A full program of events will keep the square bustling throughout December and January, with sessions showcasing local DJs and artists held twice a week, and free health and wellness sessions daily. Prahran Square Live will take place on Thursday evenings, and there’ll be Ambient Sunday sessions each weekend too. On Saturday mornings, local buskers will provide the entertainment.</p>
      <p>Other features at Prahran Square include an accessible forest walk, a children’s playground and terraced seating. At the northern end of the square you’ll find huge planter boxes and a sensory garden of 130 large trees and palms, and more than 7200 plants and shrubs.</p>
      <p>Australian artworks feature throughout the square. There’s “living” art installations by Jamie North, a bee sculpture by Doctor Fiona Foley and a digital work by Bruce Ramus. Throughout the summer, street artists will create art in the square too.</p>
