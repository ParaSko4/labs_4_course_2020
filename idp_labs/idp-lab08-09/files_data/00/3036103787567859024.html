      <h1>Intel unveils new high-performance graphics card</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/bradley-prior" target="_blank">Bradley Prior</a></address>
      <p>Intel has <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/intel-unveils-new-gpu-architecture-optimized-for-hpc-ai-oneapi/#gs.gqx6s4"><b>unveiled</b></a> its new 7nm graphics card – codenamed Ponte Vecchio – which is designed for high-end computing workloads.</p>
      <p>The Ponte Vecchio uses Intel’s new Xe Graphics Architecture and is designed for applications such as HPC modelling, simulation workloads, and AI training.</p>
      <p>“Ponte Vecchio will leverage Intel’s Foveros 3D and EMIB packaging innovations and feature multiple technologies in-package, including high-bandwidth memory, Compute Express Link interconnect and other intellectual property,” said Intel.</p>
      <p>Ponte Vecchio GPUs will be used in Intel’s Aurora system at Argonne National Laboratory, which is set to launch in 2021 and will be the first exascale-class supercomputer ever.</p>
      <p>“The compute node architecture of Aurora will feature two 10nm-based Intel Xeon Scalable processors (code-named “Sapphire Rapids”) and six Ponte Vecchio GPUs,” said Intel.</p>
      <p>According to Intel, Aurora will also support over 10 petabytes of memory and over 230 petabytes of storage.</p>
      <p>Intel also offered information about its OneAPI programming model, which is designed to deliver cross-architecture performance and will be also used in the Aurora system.</p>
      <p>“OneAPI delivers a unified and open programming experience to developers on the architecture of their choice without compromising performance and eliminating the complexity of separate code bases, multiple-programming languages, and different tools and workflows,” said Intel.</p>
