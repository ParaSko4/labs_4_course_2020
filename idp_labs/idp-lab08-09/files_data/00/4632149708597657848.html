      <h1>Gazing outwards: The various facets of law enforcement</h1>

      <p><i>By Joshua Muyiwa</i> <br/><br/>There seemed to be a wave at one point, among activists in my circle of friends and acquaintances of changing their tune and turning towards studying the law. For so long, these people had had the Gandhi seats to systemic violence and they were tired of celebrating their small glories, or perhaps were fueled by these moments of joys and wanted to convert them into big gains for their causes and commitments. After years of being in the thick, they were stepping out to enrol themselves into law courses and were determined to use the law as it was imagined to be used – for positive change in society. Or maybe they thought wielding it would give them a much better handle on the situation. And then, it all just crashed down, just the way that it had all appeared. <br/><br/>I think a few of them carried on, even fewer got the degree certificate but a majority decided to stop, and get back on to their previous routes. For all who had left, it wasn’t just disappointment in the method of teaching the law – the cranky lecturers, the persistent problems with institutions and the silly syllabus requirements. It was also the sudden realisation that things play out differently when translated through the medium of the law. They understood that the law just functions differently. It felt like the same way that jokes don’t play out well across two languages, pain and suffering weren’t immediate or understood through the law. It was a different beast. <br/><br/><br/>One of those things that get said in most of our families is the line that’s funny but also has an element of truth in it: lawyers are liars. And while it is meant to be a derisive thing, one doesn’t have to think of it as so. They don’t lie – as most legal dramas on television will inform us – they retell, revise and recontextualise something till it shines only in a certain light, which for the sake of the argument, they’ll call “the truth”. I’d imagine that this was a difficult pill for these people to swallow after years of realising that the truth doesn’t need quotation marks. It manages to usually stand up on its own. <br/><br/>Since I can remember, the written law hasn’t meant very much to me. It has always acted as hurdles through its other branches – the bureaucracy and the police – in my life. But then, one simply learns to avoid encountering these entities, and it seems fine. But, even if it doesn’t mean much, it has been insisting to be seen, heard and felt for a long, long time. And lately, everything seems to boil down to a judgement. We seem to take cues on the way to live our everyday lives from every minute change in the law of the land. Just recently, my flatmate, who works in the corporate space, was trying to explain to me the difference between “the market” and “society” while talking about the economics around app-based products. It seemed a failed service because every time he said, “the market acts this way”, I would insist that is the way “society” acts as well. I felt this artificial separation he was attempting to make between these two ideas was false. So, perhaps, the separation between the law and us is a false one too? <br/><br/><br/>In hindsight, I can see the reason these activists around me were intrigued by the letter of the law, and I’m convinced they were onto something when they decided to study it. In my opinion, their error lay in wanting to practice it. Each day, the newspapers are informing us of amendments to the law, the actions by the courts, the ways that lawyers intercedes for us and so on. And each day, I feel like a dumb spectator to these proceedings. I wish I knew more about it, I wish I was taught about it, and had learned about it in a way that was practical and sensible. Don’t get me wrong, on reading the judgements, I catch the tenor, tone and treatment – we all do. It is after all us speaking in a very convoluted tongue. I’m also dumb because I can’t see, hear or feel myself in any of these new judgements. The other error of my activist friends and acquaintances was their faith in this institution while they’d expunged this emotion with regards to everything else. The faith that the law lights and leads the way even if our cities were threatened to be burnt.</p>
