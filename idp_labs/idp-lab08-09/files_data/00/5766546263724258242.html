      <p><b>Monrovia –</b> ‘She’s the Way Summit’, a one-day all-girls gathering, brought together over 500 girls and young women from several universities and high schools to listen and learn from the success stories of prominent women in the society. The participants were given the opportunity to ask questions to panelists on different issues of concern. </p>
      <p>The summit was focused on five key topics including,  the Beauty Myth; Religion, Tradition, Marriage and Culture; Education &amp; Career; Health; Women in politics and women in business.</p>
      <p>Held under the theme “HOW DID YOU BECOME THE WOMAN YOU ARE TODAY? with reference on challenges faced and how they were overcome,” the summit offered young girls the chance to look beyond themselves.</p>
      <p>Hawa Flomo, Country Director of the MacDella Cooper Foundation (MCF), averred that over the years Ms. Cooper, through the MCF has committed to ‘endlessly’ reaching out to providing solutions to real-life issues in and out of the Liberian society.</p>
      <p>“The empowerment of the female gender has been a gap in the Liberian society and the ‘She’s the Way Summit’ is a direct impact to the less-considered female population of our society,” said Flomo, who challenged the participants to make maximum use of the ‘privilege’ given them to participate in the summit.</p>
      <p>“You can all be more than me and even more than the wonderful panelists here today. So, do not let this opportunity pass you by. ‘She’s the Way’ is here to help you find a great way to success,” she stressed.</p>
      <p>Fredrica Perkins-Modad, CEO of the Bliss Unisex Salon, addressing ‘The Beauty Myth’, said she sees beauty not only as the physical appearance but also one’s values and integrity. “I see beauty as that special charisma that you possess, which has to do with your heart, your commitment and being fearless and confident in what you do,” stated Mrs. Modad.</p>

      <p>Mrs. Modad, however, stressed that beauty can also be undermined in a variety of ways if an individual does not have a personal relationship with oneself. “If you don’t have that personal relationship in society with your friend, especially yourself; how well you keep your personal private space, it can be undermined. I don’t care how beautiful you can be. You can put all the jewelry and make-up on, once you don’t have that self-esteem, you will lose that beauty,” she stressed.</p>

      <p>Ms. Barkue Tubman, CEO of the MBL International Group and owner of Peace Cafe’ and Capital Room, speaking on the issue of beauty, told participants that there are a lot of challenges that comes with being beautiful. “So, because you do look good, you must work harder. Beauty can fade; God forbid you are involved in an accident, so because of that your beauty has to come with a purpose and brain.”</p>
      <p>Ms. Tubman urged participants to prove to people who just judge them based on their beauty, that they are more than just their outer appearance. “Prove to them that with this beauty don’t take me for granted; know that I am coming with substance,” she urged the girls.</p>
      <p>The young girls also had the opportunity to hear from Swedish Ambassador, Ingrid Witterqvist, who was asked several questions by the young women moderators about her life and how she became the woman she is at the moment. Ambassador Witterqvist, explained that she had many targets, like being a working woman while growing-up but being an ambassador was the greatest target of all. “So, one day I applied to the Ministry of Foreign affairs and I was accepted.”</p>
      <p>Ambassador Witterqvist said female ambassadors before her helped to pave the way for her as it relates to gender gaps. “They were not given the right resources because of their gender in the past but they had to fight their way through.”</p>
      <p>The event which was held on Friday at the Monrovia Christian Fellowship Church auditorium on 9th street in Sinkor, was organized by Leila Vanetta Delaney and sponsored by the MacDella Cooper Foundation.</p>
