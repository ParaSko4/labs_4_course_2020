      <p>Early Spotify investor Northzone has today announced its ninth fund at $500m (£387.5m), which it said was raised at “record speed”.</p>
      <p>The oversubscribed pot attracted both new and existing investors, as a result of increasing interest in European early-stage startups. It takes the total amount raised by the Swedish venture capital giant to €1.5bn (£1.3bn).</p>
      <p>Northzone said the fund will hone in on both consumer and business-focused companies across Europe and the US eastern coast, targeting those at series A and B stages of growth.</p>

      <p>Founded in 1996, it has made its name through a number of notable investments in companies such as iZettle, Trustpilot and Klarna.</p>
      <p>Highlighted sectors for the new fund include fintech, health, education, mobility and construction.</p>
      <p>Dubbed Northzone IX, some of the fund has already been distributed through rounds for London’s Generation Z marketing platform Pollen, construction startup Spacemaker in Oslo, and Livepeer in New York City.</p>
      <p>“The startup ecosystems beyond Silicon Valley have seen a step change in recent years in quality, scale and an abundance of experienced founder and operator talent, along with deeper pockets of capital,” said Northzone partner Paul Murphy.</p>
      <p>“There has never been a better time for tech entrepreneurs in Europe.”</p>

      <p>Following the launch of Northzone IX, the firm said it had promoted Hello Fresh co-founder Jessica Schultz and Dots co-founder Murphy to the role of general partner. It has also promoted Wendy Xiao Schadeck and Chris Steinau as principals.</p>
      <p>Schultz said: “This latest fund puts us in a strong position, together with our collective experience as investors, founders and operators, to back early-stage founders with the greatest potential.”</p>
