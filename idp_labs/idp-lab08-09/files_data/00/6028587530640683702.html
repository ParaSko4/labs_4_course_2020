      <p>Will 2020 be the year Donald Trump gets his long-desired weaker dollar? Reading between the lines of his recent speech on the economy, it is easy to see why Japan Inc. fears just that. In recent days, corporate icons Asahi, Mitsubishi Motors, <a href="https://www.asiatimes.com/2019/11/article/nissan-slashes-forecast-as-first-half-profit-falls/">Nissan</a>, Shiseido and others pointed to expected currency moves as they revise down earnings guidance for the coming 12 months. Admittedly, the U.S. president’s Nov. 12 comments to the Economic Club of New York were more word salad than cogent argument for raising America’s game. Yet two bullet points stood out. First, Trump took particular umbrage at the Federal Reserve’s refusal to serve as his personal ATM — and holding interest rates higher than in many developed nations.</p>
      <p>“Give me some of that,” <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-economic-club-new-york-new-york-ny/">Trump said</a>. “Give me some of that money. I want some of that money. Our Federal Reserve doesn’t let us do it.” Second, he said the U.S. will hit China even harder if President Xi Jinping does not sign a comprehensive trade deal. “If we don’t make a deal, we’re going to substantially raise those tariffs,” Trump said. “They are going to be raised very substantially. And that is going to be true for other countries that mistreat us too.” Now consider what is not going to happen anytime soon.</p>
      <p>After three rate cuts this year, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is unlikely to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a058oEbZFxU">ease again</a>. Powell will want to maintain some semblance of central-bank independence. Nor is China’s strongest leader in generations about to acquiesce to a White House pushing China’s growth to the lowest levels since the early 1990s.</p>
      <p>A “phase one deal” that tamps down tensions, sure. A wholesale realignment of Sino-U.S. trade of the kind Trump promised his base? Fat chance. In September, Xi reportedly told Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that he “can’t believe” what Trump says. How many times, after all, has Trump claimed a China deal is imminent — only for Xi’s team to deny it? Trump will not take Xi’s rejection well. Nor will Abe’s government be particularly receptive to a phase-two deal with Team Trump. The initial deal, which Trump and Abe signed Oct. 7, made barely a ripple in the international media. At the same time, Trump’s impeachment troubles leave him few legislative or policy options in Washington. Other than the dollar, that is.</p>
      <p>The exchange rate has been a particular Trump obsession since his 2016 campaign. In January 2017, just before taking office, Trump complained that “<a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/trump-trade-war-strong-dollar-defies-desire-for-weak-currency-2019-8-1028460361">our currency is too strong</a>” and “killing us.” Twelve months later, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin declared dead America’s 23-year-old strong dollar policy.</p>
      <p>The dollar has not cracked just yet. America’s comparatively robust growth and global uncertainty kept demand firm for U.S. Treasury securities.</p>
      <p>That may change in 2020 as growth cools and Trump searches for quick fixes. The 1.9% pace the U.S. recorded in the third quarter year-on-year is a long way from the 5% to 6% Trump promised. As Nov. 3, 2020 approaches, Trump will be increasingly desperate to accelerate growth and juice asset markets anew.</p>
      <p>The $1.5 trillion tax cut Trump’s Republican Party enacted in December 2017 leaves little fiscal space for new government stimulus. The Powell Fed only has between 1.5% and 1.75% of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/13/feds-powell-says-rates-unlikely-to-change-as-long-as-growth-continues.html">monetary ammunition</a> left.</p>
      <p>That leaves the dollar. It has been more than eight years since the U.S. Treasury intervened in currency markets. That was to cap the yen, which soared after the giant March 2011 earthquake. At the time, traders bet that Japanese companies and funds would pull money back to Japan to cover the costs of the devastation. Treasury officials stepped in to tame the yen.</p>
      <p>Now, the odds favor Trump directing Mnuchin’s team to talk down the exchange rate — and perhaps formally sell dollars versus the yen and euro. There is no telling how the global financial system might response to Trump actively engineering a lower dollar.</p>
      <p>The bottom could fall out fast, given how Trump has larded up the national balance sheet with <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/finance/468600-us-debt-surpasses-23-trillion-for-first-time">runaway debt</a>. Washington’s burden is now an unthinkable $23 trillion.</p>
      <p>A swooning dollar is arguably Japan Inc.’s biggest nightmare heading into 2020. Already, the trade war has Asia’s No. 2 economy skirting recession. Annualized growth of 0.2% in the July-September period leaves little cushion. Exports <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/japan-economy-trade/japan-september-exports-fall-5-2-year-year-mof-idUST9N25106W">fell 5.2%</a> in September from a year earlier, down for a 10th consecutive month. Producer prices, meantime, fell 0.4% in October year-on-year. It was the fifth straight monthly drop and a reminder of how far the Bank of Japan is from its 2% price goal.</p>
      <p>A rising yen would be an added headwind. While it is up just 0.8% against the dollar this year, the yen has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/EURJPY:CUR">surged 4.9%</a> versus the euro and about 2% versus the Chinese yuan.</p>
      <p>Any Trump-related boost to the yen would hit Japan Inc. in two ways: reduced export competitiveness and erosion of profits as companies repatriate funds into a rising currency. This latter risk has increased as corporate Japan expands overseas to become less dependent on an aging, shrinking home market.</p>
      <p>There also is an economy-wide threat to consider. The real propellant behind Japan’s longest expansion since the 1980s was a 30% drop in the yen. Trump getting the weaker dollar of his dreams in 2020 could be a nightmare for Asia.</p>
