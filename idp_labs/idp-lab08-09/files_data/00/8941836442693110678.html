      <h1>Colorful T-Mobile CEO leaving, even as Sprint deal not done</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">The Associated Press</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/t-mobile/">T-Mobile</a> said Monday its colorful CEO <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-legere/">John Legere</a> is stepping down next year, even as the wireless company’s long-running effort to merge with rival <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sprint/">Sprint</a> remains unfinished.</p>
      <p>Its current president and chief operating officer, Mike Sievert, will become CEO in May after <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-legere/">Legere</a>’s contract ends.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/t-mobile/">T-Mobile</a> is trying to combine with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sprint/">Sprint</a> in a $26.5 billion deal. Federal regulators have approved the deal, but attorneys general of 15 states and the District of Columbia aim to block it, saying it will raise prices for consumers. A trial is to start in December.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-legere/">Legere</a> will remain with the Bellevue, Washington-company as a board member. Sievert has worked at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/t-mobile/">T-Mobile</a> since 2012 and has been a board member for nearly two years.</p>
      <p>The company said Monday that the move is part of its succession plan.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-legere/">Legere</a> joined <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/t-mobile/">T-Mobile</a> as its CEO in 2012 and, unlike most telecom executives, has an active social-media presence where he regularly disparages his wireless rivals and promotes <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/t-mobile/">T-Mobile</a> as a consumer-friendly wireless company.</p>
      <p>“I’m not going anywhere soon. This is all part of a multiyear plan,” he wrote on Twitter, where he has 6.5 million followers.</p>
      <p>On a call with investors, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-legere/">Legere</a> pushed back against reports that he had been in discussions to be CEO of the troubled office-space company WeWork.</p>
