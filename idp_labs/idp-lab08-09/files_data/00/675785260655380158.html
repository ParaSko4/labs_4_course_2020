      <p>A £3million lottery winner has treated herself to a boob job after spending almost £10,000 on the same op for her two sisters.</p>
      <p>Sarah Cockings, paid for plastic surgery for Emma, 37, and Alex, 32, as well as splashing out on a house for her parents, a Mini Cooper and a Range Rover Sport.</p>
      <p>She also went back to university because her mum “wanted that picture of me graduating – which she has now on her mantelpiece”.</p>

      <p>Sarah, 36, once joked how people stopped her sisters in the street to ask: <br/>'Are those the lottery boobs?'</p>
      <p>Celebrating the lottery's 25th birthday with other winners, Sarah, of Whitley Bay, North Tyneside, said: "Just after I won, I bought my two sisters boob jobs; everyone remembers that.</p>
      <p>"But now – I’ve had one myself, because mine were wrecked by breastfeeding. It’s my two-year boob birthday. I love them!</p>

      <p>"My eldest son is six, and he tells everyone I won the Lottery.</p>
      <p>"He came home from school and said ‘I told my teacher you won the jackpot and she was laughing'.</p>
      <p>"I bought my house outright, and I have a nice car but I live a very normal life."</p>
