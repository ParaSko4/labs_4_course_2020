      <p>A former commercial bus (trotro) driver has been named one of the best graduating students at the University of Ghana at the just ended November 2019 Congregation ceremonies.</p>
      <p>Jacob Semekor Mordzifa, a Bachelor of Arts student with a major in Geography and Resource Development, obtained a final grade point average (FGPA) of 3.91.</p>
      <p>The 34-year old man, in an interview with JoyNews, revealed he had gained admission to the University of Ghana in 2005 but failed to go to school as his family could not financially support his educational pursuits.</p>
      <p>Mr Mordzifa who had completed his secondary education in Sogakope Senior High School settled for a job as a trotro driver after other jobs he pursed failed until he amassed some fund to complete his education.</p>
      <p>“My driving force was the fact that out of a non-educated family of 21, with 6 wives to my dad, I could be the one to go to school and bring some light to the house,” he said.</p>
      <p>Although he could not save enough for university education, the now first-class student, took himself to Akropong-Akuapem Teacher Training College, with the little he had.</p>
      <p>During his training college days, Mr Mordzifa saved up his allowances so he could pursue the university education he’s always wanted.</p>
      <p>He gained admission to the Unversity of Ghana after applying again for it in 2015.</p>
      <p>Mr Mordzifa got married in 2017, in his second year in the university, a decision his lecture had advised against. The lecture was concerned the brilliant student could not completely fulfil his responsibility as a husband while studying.</p>
      <p>However, he surprised many people when he did not fault in his mission to do right by his books and his wife and managed to graduate the top of his class.</p>
      <p>Mr Mordzifa, who aspires to be a decorated academic and astute lecturer, is grateful to the Ghana Education Service for granting him study leave with pay. This, he explained gave him the financial capability to pursue his dreams.</p>
