We know the show has already been renewed for a <a href="https://www.glitched.africa/the-witcher-netflix-show-already-renewed-for-season-2/">second season</a> ahead of its 20 December debut and by the sounds of things, Geralt is going to be around for a very long time. New details of the upcoming first season of the show have surfaced including Geralt’s age and why he ventures off on his journey in the first place.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://redanianintelligence.com/2019/11/16/the-witchers-lauren-hissrich-and-freya-allan-talk-fantasy-character-journeys-and-fan-expectations/">SciFiNow</a>, showrunner Lauren S. Hissrich revealed that Geralt will be almost 100 years old when the first episode of The Witcher debuts next month. Hissrish broke down the creative choices she made when creating Henry Cavill’s character.</p>
      <blockquote>I went through and with the writers picked out not just my favorite stories, although I picked some of my favorites, but the stories that I thought best illustrated what The Witcher is about. That’s kind of where we start off.”</blockquote>
      <p>According to Hissrich, the first episode of the show will kick off while Geralt is in the middle of a journey.</p>
      <blockquote>Geralt is almost 100 years old when the series starts and we find him in the middle of a journey. Then there’s the death of a character and that’s what launches him off onto his journey. That starts to complicate things for a man who thought he’d had it all figured out. It’s a pretty fun place to start. It’s really a character on the edge of a new journey.”</blockquote>
      <p>If you are wondering why Geralt does not look a day over 50, it is due to his Witcher genes that are chemically enhanced to make him a crazy supernatural monster-slaying machine.</p>
      <p>We will know more about the show as we lead up to its debut next month. Let us know if you are planning on binging the whole of Netflix’s The Witcher all at once down in the comments section below.</p>
