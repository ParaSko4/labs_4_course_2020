      <p>Egyptian champion Mohamed Safwat of Wadi Degla has advanced to the world number 176 in the last rankings of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) after Safwat has made an outstanding level in the last few days to reach the final of the Helsinki Championship where he finished second. <br/><br/>Safwat is seeking to return to the best position he has reached in the world rankings, the 166th position in the world. <br/><br/>Safwat's progress in the rankings to 176th position has gone a long way in advancing to the best ranks during his career, where the Egyptian champion has fallen to the No. 216. <br/><br/>Returning to the top 200, he finished top of the Arab rankings after finishing runner-up in Challenger, Finland, where he could not win the playoff group to end the 141-ranked Finn Emil Rusovori, 2-6 7-6 3-6.</p>
