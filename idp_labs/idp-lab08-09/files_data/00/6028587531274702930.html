      <p>The <a href="https://www.thehermitagehotel.com/">Hermitage Hotel</a> was named the “Best City Center Historic Hotel” by the Historic Hotels of America at the 2019 Awards of Excellence. <a href="https://savingplaces.org/historic-hotels-of-america#.XdHX8XdFzct">Historic Hotels of America</a> is the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation for recognizing and celebrating the finest historic hotels around the country. The annual awards honor the most exemplary historic hotel properties, hoteliers and leadership practices.</p>
      <p>A popular phrase in Nashville for over a century has been, "Meet me at the Hermitage Hotel." Located at the corner of Sixth and Union, this hospitality landmark in <a href="https://www.nashvilledowntown.com/">downtown Nashville</a> features 122 luxurious guest <a href="https://www.thehermitagehotel.com/rooms-and-suites.htm">rooms and suites</a>, ranging from 500 to 2,000 square feet.</p>
      <p>Indoors and out – from the inviting sidewalk canopy, to the comfortable elegance of the lobby with stained glass skylights – guests embark on a brilliantly balanced high-style yet home-away-from-home experience. The Hermitage Hotel is a <a href="https://www.forbestravelguide.com/hotels/nashville-tennessee/the-hermitage-hotel">Forbes Travel Guide Five-Star hotel</a>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.thehermitagehotel.com/pet-friendly.htm">pet-friendly</a> hotel offers a plethora of amenities and conveniences for guests and visitors, including a <a href="https://www.capitolgrillenashville.com/">restaurant</a>, bar, <a href="https://www.thehermitagehotel.com/spa.htm">spa</a>, fitness center, <a href="https://rachelsboutique.com/">boutique</a>, 24-hour concierge, on-call limo service, valet parking in a covered garage, plus more than 5,400 square feet of <a href="https://www.thehermitagehotel.com/meetings-and-events.htm">event and meeting</a> space by way of five opulent venues.</p>
      <p>Built from 1908 until it opened in 1910, the hotel building was <a href="https://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entries/j-edwin-r-carpenter/">designed by J. Edwin R. Carpenter</a>, a nationally-renowned architect originally from Tennessee. The 10-story, Beaux Arts skyscraper became known as Nashville’s first million-dollar hotel. Historic restorations and refurbishments have refined and retained the hotel architecture in the context of downtown’s growing skyline. The Hermitage Hotel is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
      <p>Having clinched the coveted title of Best City Center Historic Hotel, this latest recognition calls for a toast in the Hermitage Hotel’s famous <a href="https://www.capitolgrillenashville.com/oak-bar.asp">Oak Bar</a>.</p>
      <p>Cheers.</p>
