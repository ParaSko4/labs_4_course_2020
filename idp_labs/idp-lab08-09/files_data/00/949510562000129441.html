      <p>DETROIT (AP) — A highway safety group says over 800 rear-seat passengers who weren’t wearing seat belts died last year in U.S. traffic crashes, showing that states aren’t making enough progress in getting people to buckle up.</p>
      <p>The Governors Highway Safety Association says more than 400 of the 803 people who died would have survived if they were belted.</p>
      <p>The association put out a report in 2015 drawing attention to rear seat-belt use. It says only two more states enacted rear seat belt laws since then.</p>
      <p>It says 20 states still don’t have laws requiring rear belt use.</p>
      <p>The federal government is seeking public comment on a rule requiring automakers to warn drivers if rear passengers aren’t belted in.</p>
