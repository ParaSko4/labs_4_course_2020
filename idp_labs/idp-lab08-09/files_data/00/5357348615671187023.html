        <b>This man leaps across a stream during pounding rain at the National Stadium in St Andrew Saturday night as Kingston College and Jamaica College competed in the Inter-Secondary Schools Sports Association Champions Cup semi-final.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Earlier, the Meteorological Service had issued a flash flood watch for low-lying and flood-prone areas of Kingston, St Andrew, Hanover, St James, Trelawny, St Ann, St Mary, Portland, St Thomas, St Catherine and Manchester. The rains were the result of a pre-frontal trough across the western Caribbean.</p>
      <p>“Satellite imagery and rainfall data indicate that light to moderate showers and, at times, heavy showers and thunderstorms have been affecting sections of north-western, central and eastern parishes, with the greatest intensity being recorded over eastern and central parishes,” the Met Service said in its news release Saturday.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, the Met Service advised that a cold front was expected to move across Jamaica. “Increased showers and thunderstorms will affect most parishes until the frontal system gradually weakens on Tuesday,” the advisory said.</p>
