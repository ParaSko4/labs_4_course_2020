      <p>ST. ALBANS, Vt. (AP) - A former Vermont police officer who was recorded on video hitting a handcuffed female prisoner is expected in court.</p>
      <p>Thirty-one-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jason-lawton/">Jason Lawton</a>, of Fletcher, is due in court Monday after being cited last week on an assault charge for the March 15 incident at the St. Albans Police Department.</p>
      <p>The video, some of it from a police body camera and some from a surveillance camera, shows the apparently intoxicated Amy Connelly being thrown against a wall in a holding cell after she refuses to sit down. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jason-lawton/">Lawton</a> punches her in the face when she stands back up and tries to kick him.</p>

        <p>State police said the charges were filed after consulting with the attorney general’s office. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jason-lawton/">Lawton</a> was fired after the incident. It’s unclear if he has a lawyer.</p>
