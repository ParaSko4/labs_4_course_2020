      <h1>Hong Kong police threaten use of live ammunition on pro-democracy protesters</h1>

      <p>Police in Hong Kong have stated that they may begin to use lethal, live ammunition on pro-democracy protesters if they do not yield to authorities.</p>
      <p>As violence has escalated among protesters hoping to maintain a level of democracy separate from the Chinese Communist Party and police attempting to restore order to the region, authorities have threatened to clamp down on resistance. Hong Kong police Superintendent Louis Lau <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/international/470859-hong-kong-police-threaten-to-use-live-bullets-on-protesters-report">stated</a> that the police would consider lethal force on protesters who are currently refusing to leave the Polytechnic University where there is currently a standoff.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong has entered its sixth month of protests over concerns that mainland China was removing the rights citizens maintained under the one government, two systems arrangement in place since 1997. Initially, demonstrators took to the streets to halt extradition legislation that would have sent Hong Kongers to China for trial, greatly changing the process afforded to them by their democratic rights. Chief Executive of Hong Kong Carrie Lam indefinitely suspended the bills, but protesters have since complained of police brutality and curtailing of free speech. Lam has since faced several calls for her resignation.</p>
      <p>Clashes between protesters, police, and bystanders have erupted into chaos and violence more recently, drawing harsher warnings from law enforcement and from Lam. "Coldblooded rioters can only imitate terror acts,” Lau said in reference to a report that bullets were fired by law enforcement at a car that was charging toward a police line.</p>
      <p>Another protester <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/video-man-turned-into-human-torch-during-attack-at-hong-kong-protests">was shot last week as protesters rallied in the streets</a>. "I do not want to go into details, but I just want to make it very clear that we will spare no effort in finding ways and means that could end the violence in Hong Kong as soon as possible," Lam said at the time. "These rioters’ actions have far exceeded their demands, and they are enemies of the people."</p>
      <p>Protesters have also taken to setting up road blockades with bricks and other debris, as well as throwing litter on train tracks and power lines. A pro-China politician was stabbed by a protester masquerading as a supporter last week. A spokesperson for the Hong Kong police indicted the increasingly unstable nature of dissent between pro-China police and pro-democracy protests. "Our society has been pushed to the brink of a total breakdown," the spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>Pro-democracy advocates have also expressed concern after the <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/a-propaganda-move-presence-of-chinese-army-in-hong-kong-troubles-pro-democracy-advocates">People's Liberation Army of mainland China</a>, which generally keep to the confines of their barracks, were spotted clearing debris over the weekend. "I think we could all do without the sight of the PLA on the streets at this sensitive time, even in an unarmed, volunteer capacity," activist and pro-Hong Kong democracy investor David Webb said. "No doubt it will be portrayed on mainland TV as the People’s heroes undoing the work of the ‘violent terrorists’ and restoring law and order."</p>
