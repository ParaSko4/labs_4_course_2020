      <p>NEW YORK - Thousands of Disney customers say they have been hacked after signing up to its online streaming service. <br/><br/>Since Disney+ went live, hackers have stolen thousands of customers' accounts and put them up for sale on the dark web, according to a report. <br/><br/>People waited on telephone and online chat lines for hours, and many still say that Disney has yet to sort their problems. <br/><br/>The company has not replied to a request for comment. <br/><br/>Disney's answer to Netflix, Disney+ is an online platform where fans can view its movies, short films and TV shows, including the Marvel and Star Wars franchises. <br/><br/>Ten million people signed up in its first week. <br/><br/>Disney+ is available in the United States, Canada and the Netherlands. <br/><br/><b>Dark web</b> <br/><br/>On 12 November, its first day live, people had technical problems and many complained on social media. <br/><br/>Others said they were locked out of their accounts, and since they contacted Disney they have not heard back. <br/><br/>According to an investigation by Zdnet, thousands of user accounts went on sale on the dark web. <br/><br/>Only hours after the service launched, hackers were selling Disney+ accounts for as little as $3. <br/><br/>A subscription to the service costs $7 a month. <br/><br/>With the help of a cyber-security researcher, the BBC also found several hacked customer accounts for sale on the dark web. <br/><br/>Thousands of these stolen accounts show what kind of subscription the person signed up with and when it expires. <br/><br/>Customers say they saw their emails and passwords changed. <br/><br/>Many say they used unique userIDs and passwords to access the streaming platform. <br/><br/>But Jason Hill, a lead researcher with CyberInt, says it looks like many were stolen because people use the same passwords for different sites. <br/><br/>Hill said that hackers can lift someone's password from a different site which has previously been hacked and then try it on a new site, like Disney+. If it works, they steal the account. <br/><br/>"Whilst many may consider having a unique password for each online service to be difficult to manage, password managers simplify this process and allow you to generate and securely store unique difficult-to-guess passwords," he said. <br/><br/>The streaming service does not have two-factor authentication. <br/><br/>This is when a separate password is sent upon login, to verify an account identity. <br/><br/>Others are concerned because they can use their Disney+ login to access other products the company provides, like the Disney store and its recreation parks. <br/><br/>The online streaming service was hit by technical issues on its first day. People took to social media to complain that their pre-ordered streaming service did not work and that they faced long waits for customer service. <br/><br/>The company said in a tweet that it had an "overwhelming response" and apologized.
