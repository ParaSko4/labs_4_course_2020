      <p>Chris Sacre has been <a href="https://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20191115/pdf/44bmjh0h2t0qw0.pdf">appointed</a> interim Chief Financial Officer (CFO) at <a href="https://www.evolveeducation.co.nz/">Evolve Education Group</a> in the wake of the incumbent CFO Stephen Davies’s decision to leave to pursue other opportunities.</p>
      <p>Mr Davies, who joined Evolve in September 2016 from NZX listed software company <a href="https://www.plexure.com/">Plexure</a>, had a wide ranging role that included financial management, strategy, operations and property related tasks.</p>
      <p>Commenting on Mr Davies’s contribution Managing Director Chris Scott said “The Board thanks Stephen for the role he played in leading the finance, support and other functions as well as his role supporting the strategic direction of the company.”</p>
      <p>Mr Davies will be replaced by Mr Sacre with immediate effect as interim CFO while a search for a new CFO is undertaken.</p>
      <p>Mr Sacre, who is currently an executive director of Evolve, previously held the CFO position at ASX listed Early Learning Services and <a href="https://g8education.edu.au/">G8 Education Ltd</a> from 2007 to 2009 and 2010 to 2016 respectively.</p>
      <p>With respect to his tenure at G8 Education Mr Sacre was instrumental in growing the network by around 400 centres and raising over $500 million in new capital.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the appointment Managing Director Chris Scott noted “Chris has been deeply involved in all financial and strategic aspects of EVO for the last 12 months. Coupled with his long industry background Chris is well placed to perform this role until the Board appoints a replacement CFO.”</p>
