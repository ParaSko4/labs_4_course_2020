      <p>New research from the road safety charity Brake has revealed that nearly a third of adults were in a collision, or had a near miss, with a vehicle on UK roads in the past year.</p>
      <p>This proportion rises to 50% where just young adults (18-34-year-olds) are concerned.</p>
      <p>Brake says the research, from a survey of 2,000 people, has been published to “highlight the level of danger felt on UK roads and to encourage people to ‘<a href="https://www.roadsafetyweek.org.uk/our-theme">Step Up for Safe Streets’ for national Road Safety Week 201</a>9”, launched today.</p>
      <p>Brake’s research highlights the high numbers of the population who have experienced danger on the roads first-hand, with one in three adults surveyed, a UK total of more than 15 million people, experiencing a collision or near miss with a vehicle on a UK road in the past year. This proportion rises to more than half when just young adults (18-34-year-olds) are concerned.</p>
      <h3>Alarming picture</h3>
      <p>Joshua Harris, director of campaigns for Brake, the road safety charity, said: “These findings paint an alarming picture of the danger on our roads and yet it’s what we’re all exposed to, every day, when getting about. We shouldn’t have to accept this level of risk as part of our daily lives and so we are calling on everyone to “Step Up” for Road Safety Week and shout out for the solutions that we know can make our roads safe.</p>
      <p>“Across the country, people are working tirelessly to campaign for safe streets, organising petitions, meeting with MPs and councillors and raising money and awareness. This Road Safety Week we want everyone to think about how they can do their bit and step up for safe streets. Can you join or start a local campaign? Do you need to take the car on your next journey, or could you walk, cycle or get the bus? If you are travelling by car, will you pledge to always keep within speed limits and never drive after drinking alcohol or taking drugs? Let’s all Step Up for Safe Streets and, together, we can help make roads safer for everyone.”</p>
      <p>Road Safety Week 2019 partners, Kwik-Fit and Specsavers, are also backing the campaign for safe streets, with Kwik-Fit offering free vehicle safety checks at more than 600 centres across the country and Specsavers touring a virtual reality driving experience to encourage people to make sure their eyesight is good enough for driving.</p>
