      <p><b>Naija News</b> reports that the National Electoral Commission (INEC), had declared <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/18/inec-declares-apcs-david-lyon-winner-of-bayelsa-election/"><u><b>David Lyon the winner of the Bayelsa Governorship Election</b></u></a>.</p>
      <p>Lyon was declared the winner of the Bayelsa election by INEC Returning Officer and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Benin, Professor Faraday Orunmuwese, on Monday morning, November 18.</p>
      <p>Professor Orunmuwese returned the APC candidate as the winner of the keenly contested Bayelsa election after scoring the highest number of votes in the poll.</p>
      <p>Lyon scored a total of 352,552 votes to defeat his closest rival and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Nigeria’s main opposition party, Duoye Diri, who polled 143,172 votes.</p>
      <p>This online news platform understands that the Minister of State for Petroleum, Timipre Sylva, led APC leaders including governor-elect <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/18/david-lyon-speaks-as-inec-declares-him-winner-of-bayelsa-governorship-election/"><u><b>David Lyon</b></u></a> and APC governors to visit the former president’s home on Monday.</p>
      <p>Speaking during the visit, Jonathan urged David Lyon to make the welfare of Bayelsa people his top priority.</p>
      <p>He said: <i>“As a former president of Nigeria, I am a father to all Bayelsans, hence my doors are open to all citizens irrespective of their political affiliations.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“I urge you to make the welfare of Bayelsa people a top priority and carry all of them along irrespective of the party they voted for.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Elections are over now, so I want you to see yourself as the governor of all and not only to the sections that voted for you. This is the way to move Bayelsa forward.”</i>
