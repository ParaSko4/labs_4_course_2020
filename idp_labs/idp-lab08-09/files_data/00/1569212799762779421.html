      <p>Customer engagement company Airship launched Airship Journeys, a new interface designed for marketers to drive simple, effective cross-channel engagements. Marketing users can use data models alongside Airship’s real-time mobile data, predictive AI and machine learning to launch cross-channel campaign activities. The low-code solution is expected to address the challenges of using drag-and-drop journey builder tools in Airship’s open platform, allowing marketers to reach customers across a number of channels from a single console.</p>
      <h3>Why we should care</h3>
      <p>As consumers continue to adopt more digital channels, their behavior is also evolving to become more selective. Consumer expectations are increasingly raising the bar for hyper-personalized messaging.</p>
      <p>“Legacy visual builders were created for an email- and desktop-centric world with far fewer channels and little concern for where a customer was or what they were doing,” said Brett Caine, CEO and president, Airship. “They’ve become complex and bloated in failed attempts to adapt to the new era where the customer experience is all about mobile and in-the-moment responsiveness with many more channels and a much greater expectation that interactions are personalized and contextually relevant.”</p>
      <p>Airship Journeys incorporates the management of digital channels into one view for marketers. Messages can be composed once and deployed across different channels. Airship Journeys also monitors and controls message frequency and uses Predictive AI to segment audiences and re-engage past customers. The solution can increase efficiencies for marketing users by allowing them to streamline their content creation and execution.</p>
