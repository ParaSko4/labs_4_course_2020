      <p>Lucky winners with a combined fortune of more than £110 million have posed for a Vanity Fair-style photo shoot to mark The National Lottery’s 25th anniversary.</p>
      <p>The 25 individuals from each year of the lottery’s existence are some of the biggest winners from more than 5,500 millionaires created since the first draw on November 19 1994.</p>
      <p>The line-up includes 84-year-old Brian Caswell, from Bolton, who won £24.9 million in 2009 and Bev Middleton, 40, from Bradford, who received £14.5 million in 2017.</p>
      <p>Mr Caswell, who now lives in a five-bedroom detached home with his wife Jean, 82, said his EuroMillions windfall not only paid for the new property, but for potentially life-saving surgery.</p>

      <p>He said: “Five years ago, I needed an emergency quadruple bypass, and instead of waiting, our daughter researched the top surgeon and I paid to go private – so the lottery has kept me healthy as well as happy.”</p>
      <p>While new homes and cars are common purchases, Cheryl Brudenell, from Stockton-on-Tees, used part of her £916,915 winnings to fund what she calls her “Robbie Hobby”.</p>
      <p>Since 2001, the 52-year-old, who won in 1997, has watched singer Robbie Williams perform around 40 times across the world.</p>
      <p>Since the first draw 25 years ago, The National Lottery said it has paid out more than £71 billion in prizes and raised £40 billion to support thousands of projects and charities across the UK.</p>

      <p>The lottery’s senior winners’ adviser Andy Carter said: “These are just a tiny fraction of some of the lucky players who have won life-changing sums of money over the past 25 years.</p>
      <p>“We have all had the ‘when I win the lottery’ conversation, but these lucky people are now living out their dreams.</p>
      <p>“And we have learnt over the years that our players are a generous lot too. From research we have discovered that 11% of winners have made additional millionaires or multi-millionaires through kind donations to family and friends.</p>
      <p>“In addition, more than 91% tell us that they have donated time or money to charities close to their hearts, meaning the benefit of every big win is reaching far and wide.”</p>
      <p>The winners, who are aged between 26 and 84, were photographed by celebrity photographer Sven Arnstein.</p>
