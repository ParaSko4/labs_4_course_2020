      <h1>UK housing market hit by Brexit and election double-whammy - Rightmove survey</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:46:05+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 00:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/dhwani-mehta" target="_blank">Dhwani Mehta</a></address>
      <p>The latest survey conducted by the UK’s property website Rightmove showed that the number of British properties put up on offer has fallen dramatically to a decade lows 10 amid <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/events/brexit">Brexit</a> and election uncertainty, per Reuters.</p>
      <h3>Key Findings:</h3>
      <p>“There were 14.9% fewer properties put on sale in the four weeks to Nov. 9 than in the same period last year.</p>
      <p>That was the biggest annual fall since August 2009, shortly after the global financial crisis.</p>
      <p>The average price of property coming to market rose by an annual 0.3%, in line with other measures showing house prices almost flat-lining, and the number of sales agreed was down by 2.9%.”</p>
