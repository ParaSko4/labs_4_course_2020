      <h1>Iker Casillas: 'Cristiano Ronaldo winning Ballon d'Or would be illogical'</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/iker-casillas/"><b>Iker Casillas</b></a> has claimed that former <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/real-madrid/"><b>Real Madrid</b></a> teammate <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/cristiano-ronaldo/"><b>Cristiano Ronaldo</b></a> winning this year's Ballon d'Or award would be illogical.</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lionel-messi/"><b>Lionel Messi</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/virgil-van-dijk/"><b>Virgil van Dijk</b></a> are said to be the frontrunners to win this year's award, which will be presented at the France Football ceremony on December 2.</p>
      <p>Despite making the 30-man shortlist, Ronaldo has not exercised the same impact at <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/juventus/"><b>Juventus</b></a> compared with his exploits in Madrid, managing 28 goals in all competitions last term - his lowest total since 2009.</p>
      <p>Reflecting on the award on social media, Casillas said: "Van Dijk was the best player for UEFA, Messi was the best for FIFA. Imagine if Cristiano wins the Ballon d'Or? It would seem to me that the guidelines we follow in football to give prizes do not have much logic."</p>
      <p>Ronaldo, who won his first Ballon d'Or in 2008, has won the award on five occasions - the last time being in 2017.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/luka-modric/"><b>Luka Modric</b></a> winning the title last year - in recognition of his performances for Croatia at the World Cup - broke a monopoly held by Messi and Ronaldo on the award since 2008.</p>
