      <p><b>TUSCALOOSA, Ala.Â (AP)</b> - Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa is scheduled to have hip surgery in Houston.</p>
      <p>Team surgeon Dr. Lyle Cain said in a statement Sunday that Tagovailoa will have surgery on his dislocated right hip Monday. An Alabama spokesman declined to disclose where he was having the surgery citing privacy reasons.</p>
      <p>Cain says the medical team "consulted with multiple orthopedic experts across the country, who specialize in hip injuries and surgeries." He reiterated that they expect Tagovailoa to make a full recovery.</p>
      <p>The fifth-ranked Crimson Tide's star, a potential top pick in April's NFL draft, was injured while being dragged down by two defenders late in the first half of Saturday's 38-7 win over Mississippi State.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa had been nursing an ankle injury and Alabama was considering holding him out of this game. Defensive linemen Phidarian Mathis and Raekwon Davis posted a picture with a smiling Tagovailoa in his hospital bed Sunday.</p>
      <p>He passed for 418 yards and four touchdowns in a loss to No. 1 LSU less than three weeks after right ankle surgery.</p>
