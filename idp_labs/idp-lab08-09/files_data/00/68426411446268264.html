        <b>University campus under siege as Hong Kong police clash with protesters</b>
      </p>
      <p>Police <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-hong-kong-police-tighten-siege-at-university-campus-as-standoff-with/">tightened their siege</a> of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus where hundreds of protesters remained trapped overnight in the latest dramatic episode in months of protests against growing Chinese control.</p>
      <p>In a sign of a fresh escalation, protests raged across other parts of the city, fuelled by public anger over the police blockade and the desire to help the students stuck inside.</p>
      <p>Universities have become the latest battleground for the protesters, who <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-hong-kong-police-rush-barricades-at-university-campus-but-retreat-in/">used gasoline bombs and arrows</a> in their fight to keep riot police backed by armoured cars and a water cannon off two campuses in the past week.</p>

        <b>Prince Andrew faces calls to retire from public life after stumbling TV interview about Jeffrey Epstein</b>
      </p>
      <p>Prince Andrew may have hoped to clear the air regarding his association with late financier and alleged sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. But instead of winning over skeptics, he’s now <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-prince-andrew-faces-furious-backlash-calls-to-retire-from-public-life/">facing a storm of criticism</a> for appearing arrogant, inconsistent and so hard to believe that some royal watchers have questioned whether he should step down from his duties.</p>
      <p>In the TV interview Saturday with the BBC’s Emily Maitlis, <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-britains-prince-andrew-categorically-denies-sex-claims/">he rejected allegations</a> that he’d had sex with underaged girls procured by Epstein, despite a photograph showing him with one accuser. He said on one date in question, he couldn’t have been with her because he was with his daughter, Princess Beatrice, at a restaurant called Pizza Express.</p>
      <p>If the interview was a failure for the Prince, <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-pizza-restaurant-inundated-with-mock-online-reviews-after-prince/">it’s been a boon</a> for the Pizza Express outlet, which has suddenly gained international fame and sparked a social-media frenzy. Fake online reviews began flooding Twitter and various websites within hours after the interview aired and the restaurant has been packed since then.</p>
      <p><b>Opinion: </b><a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-we-should-thank-prince-andrew-for-his-disastrous-bbc-interview/">Elizabeth Renzetti argues</a> the interview “is widely being described as a disaster, but it was not that at all. Quite the opposite: It was a Christmas miracle come early for the way it exposed how power clings to its own and disdains anyone it considers unworthy.”</p>

        <b>City of Dresden declares a ‘Nazi emergency’ amid rise of the far-right in Germany</b>
      </p>
      <p>Amid the festive celebrations this month marking the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, Dresden has delivered a jolting reminder of a much darker period in Germany’s past.</p>
      <p>Days before commemoration of the country’s 1989 reunification began, municipal council <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-city-of-dresden-declares-a-nazi-emergency-amid-rise-of-the-far-right/">declared a “Nazi emergency”</a> in the city, which in recent years has become synonymous with the resurgence of Germany’s far-right.</p>
      <p>City councillor Max Aschenbach said he introduced the motion – which passed by a 39 to 29 vote – hoping it would draw attention to the scope of Dresden’s problem with extremists, and embarrass Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government into taking action.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What to expect this week in the Trump impeachment probe</b>
      </p>
      <p>Public hearings into the impeachment probe of U.S. President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-trump-impeachment-hearings-schedule-week-2/">resume tomorrow</a> with the appearance of Jennifer Williams, a foreign-policy aide to Vice-President Mike Pence. In earlier, closed-door testimony, she called some of Trump’s comments on a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last summer “inappropriate.” Trump took to Twitter to <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-pence-aide-said-trumps-ukraine-phone-call-was-unusual-and/">lash out at Williams</a> ahead of her testimony.</p>
      <p><b>Also appearing: </b>Kurt Volker, a former special U.S. representative for Ukraine, is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon. He was a pivotal witness early in the inquiry, releasing a series of text messages that included Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, and Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, discussing why security assistance to the country was being withheld. Sondland is set to appear on Wednesday.</p>

      <p><b>Strike vote for Ontario high school teachers, education workers: </b>The union representing Ontario’s high school teachers and education workers says its members have voted 95 per cent and 92 per cent, respectively, <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-ontarios-english-catholic-teachers-file-for-conciliation-in-talks/">in favour of a strike.</a></p>

The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&amp;P/TSX composite index closed down 3.36 points at 17,025.11.</p>

        <b>On Saturday, Don Cherry was erased from Hockey Night in Canada in more ways than one</b>
      </p>
      <p>“On the one hand, it must hurt Cherry to see himself excised like that. On the other, for a man who never hid his disgust for the Soviet regime, it might be comforting to see himself as a Trotsky-type figure.” <i>- </i><a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/article-don-cherry-was-erased-from-hockey-night-in-canada-in-more-ways-than/"><i>Simon Houpt</i></a></p>

        <b>Canada’s gloomy economic outlook may put federal finances at risk</b>
      </p>
      <p>"The risk of recession is increasing, which means any surge in discretionary government spending will erode federal finances if – perhaps more accurately, when – a recession arrives. <i>- </i><a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-canadas-gloomy-economic-outlook-may-put-federal-finances-at-risk/"><i>Tegan Hill, Jake Fuss and Jason Clemens</i></a><i>, economists, the Fraser Institute.</i></p>

        <b>LIVING BETTER</b>
      </p>
      <p>Frozen foods get a bad rap, but some can be more nutritious than their fresh counterparts – and tastier too during Canada’s long winter. Consider stocking your freezer with <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/article-five-healthy-foods-you-should-always-keep-in-your-freezer/">some of these items</a>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Avocado: </b>(Yes, really.) Add frozen chunks to smoothies and protein shakes. Or thaw and use in salads, tacos and dips, or spread them on toast.</li>
        <li><b>Edamame (shelled).</b> Toss these green soybeans straight from the freezer into a vegetable stir-fry or a soup near the end of cooking. You can also add them to salads or whole-grain bowls.</li>
      </ul>

        <b>Fries, with extra dough: a Quebec poutine maker turns to patrons for help in a labour crunch</b>
      </p>
      <p>Even the godfather of poutine is having trouble finding staff amid Quebec’s severe labour shortage and booming economy. And he’s turning to his diners to help.</p>
      <p>Ashton Leblond is the founder and chief executive of Quebec City region fast-food chain Chez Ashton, a 50-year-old institution venerated for its generous servings of golden French fries topped with cheese curds and brown gravy.</p>
      <p>This month, the company started applying a 12-per-cent surcharge on food served between midnight and 5 a.m. as a way to increase employee wages, attract staff and keep from closing early. The decision was made after customers told Leblond’s team they’d be okay with paying more during that time.</p>
      <p>He adds that for many clients out in the dead of night, having a poutine is a habit before bed. “They eat and they’re satisfied. It’s almost like a drug fix.” <i>Read Nicolas Van Praet’s </i><a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-fries-with-extra-dough-a-quebec-poutine-maker-turns-to-patrons-for/"><i>full story here</i></a><i>.</i></p>
