      <p>That’s a little more like it.Sports fans were likely looking for their motivation to buy a Google Stadia console after looking at the initial list of launch titles and seeing none of the popualr franchises from their genre represented.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, a revised list was released per The Game Awards’ Geoff Keighley and it includes NBA 2K20 and two other sports titles.</p>
      <p>Google Stadia hits retailers on November 19 and it looks to carve a piece of the gaming pie. The cloud-based console is designed to allow its owners to play the latest games without needing the likes of a PS4, Xbox One or high-end PC.</p>
      <p>While bigger titles like Mortal Kombat 11, Final Fantasy XV, and Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey are strong additions to the launch, the title list looked a bit barren without some of the top sports titles we’d seen associated with the new console.</p>
      <p>Many gamers are already a bit skeptical because some of the features that were originally mentioned when the Stadia concept was introduced <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-stadia-launch-features/">won’t be available at launch</a>. There’s also he normal apprehension whenever a new console that doesn’t come from Sony, Microsoft or Nintendo hits the shelves.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the inclusion of NBA 2K20, a game that has sold upwards of 10 million copies per year since 2017, will help to spark more interests. Be on the lookout for coverage of Google Stadia’s release this week. Hopefully, I’ll get an opportunity to give the sports titles a test so that I can share the experience with those who haven’t taken the plunge into the newest addition to the gaming console universe.</p>
