      <p><i>This article is part of a series I’ll do leading up to Thanksgiving and during the holidays about the benefits of infusing kindness, gratitude, and presence into your work experience. </i><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/karlynborysenko"><i>Follow along</i></a><i>. </i>When you imagine of the organizational culture created by a typical tech entrepreneur, encouraging employees to <i>disconnect</i> from technology would probably not be the first attribute to come to mind! But Hinge CEO Justin McLeod is not your typical tech entrepreneur. Not only has he <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hinge-ceo-no-email-on-phone-2018-10">deleted his email</a> and social media from his own phone, but he also encourages his people to follow this example and do the same.</p>
      <p>“It's just amazing how resistant people are to pulling slack off of their phones and email off of their phones. But I'm working now to develop a pilot program, along with one of my teams, where everyone will promise to delete stuff from their phones and report back to the rest of the team what the experience is like. I know that people are going to feel happier and better once they stop.”</p>
      <p>And he’s right. Addiction specialists report that overusing technology, particularly social media, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/in-excess/201805/addicted-social-media">has a variety of detrimental outcomes</a> including negatively impacting real-life relationships and increasing the likelihood of anxiety, depression, ADHD, poor sleeping habits and a general feeling of loneliness or lack of belonging.</p>
      <p>When it comes to work, a <a href="https://getvoip.com/blog/2017/05/15/digital-detox/">digital detox</a> has been shown to boost productivity and creativity, improve working relationships, increase attention span, reduce individual stress and improve analytical skills and problem-solving abilities. Technology use related to the job also has a direct impact on work-life balance. According to a study from <a href="https://www.workfront.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/04/workfront-work-life-imbalance-report.pdf">Workfront</a>, over half of employees think technology has ruined family dinner because emails or texts may come from employers at any hour, and 39% reported constantly working beyond standard business hours as a key cause of their lack of balance.</p>
      <p>McLeod feels strongly about this after experiencing the benefits of reducing his addiction to technology in his personal life. “As someone who’s been really conscious of removing addictions like drugs and alcohol from my life, it’s just natural. You have those cravings to go and check your phone, and you’re being mindless about it - it’s another form of addiction. I was using technology and not wanting to use it destructively. It’s the discipline of learning how not to react to those cravings.”</p>
      <p>McLeod credits a consistent mindfulness practice with helping him to gain more presence, which helped him to tackle those cravings and spur his own creative thinking. “I think it's learning to sit with yourself, right? It's learning just how to be and not have to react to your cravings that are arising, even the craving to pull out your phone. The biggest thing for me is a morning routine. I mean, that really, I think, sets the foundation for my day. I mean, I wake up every single morning, I make my lemon water, I do my 45 minutes of yoga and my meditation and, then, I sit and I journal for a bit. When I journal, that's when all my ideas come to me or people that I want to reach out to or things that I want to do that just wouldn't even occur to me if I were just jumping right into my phone and checking email. I would miss all those opportunities and all the things that come to me in the morning, as I'm doing my routine.”</p>
      <p>Though he’s made the choice to reduce or eliminate certain technology from his experience, McLeod has also adapted different tools to his workflow to best support his team. “Everyone who works closely with me at Hinge knows, that if something's truly urgent, they have to text me. So texts come through urgently and I'll respond to a text urgently, but anything that gets sent over email, I’ll just get to it when I'm next at a computer. That's just how it works. And I'm lucky to be in a position where I can say that and people will listen to me. I think it'd be useful if we all encouraged our coworkers to adopt something like this.”</p>
      <p>What if we encouraged our coworkers to do it, indeed. Even better, what if other CEO’s or organizational leaders encouraged their organization in the same way? If we accept overuse of technology has a negative impact on work-life balance, and then accept that a lack of work-life balance will have a negative impact on an employee’s level of productivity (spoiler alert: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325483699_The_Relationship_between_Job_Satisfaction_Work-Life_Balance_and_Organizational_Commitment_on_Employee_Performance">it does</a>), then it is simply a prudent business decision to cultivate an environment in which employees utilize technology effectively, but not addictively. If a business can figure out the secret sauce of helping their employees unplug, it will directly not only contribute to the health and sustainability of the business, but also to the the individual well-being of each person who works there.</p>
