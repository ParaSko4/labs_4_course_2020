      <h1>This Dino 308 GT4 Safari Was Built To Go Where Most Ferraris Fear To Tread</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://petrolicious.com/author/news-desk" target="_blank">News Desk</a></address>
      <p>The Ferrari 308 GT4 was a revolutionary model for the brand. Introduced in 1973, it was the marque’s first V8 and it bore the Dino moniker for the first few years of production to differentiate it from Ferrari’s V12 offerings.</p>
      <p>The Marcello Gandini-styled angular 2+2 bodywork was a big departure from the norm too, perhaps lacking some of the inherent attractiveness of the earlier Dino 246 GT. What it did have was a 240hp (255hp for European versions) 2.9-liter mid-mounted V8, giving the light GT4 performance that was not far off the bigger and heavier V12 models.</p>

      <p>While this model remains the only 2+2 Ferrari ever raced with factory support, one thing even they never attempted was to take this versatile little sports car rallying. In fact, Ferrari’s official efforts were limited to a short stint in Group B and Group 4 with the 308 GTB (a car that shares much of its basic underpinnings with the GT4).</p>
      <p>So, what you see here, then, is a one-off creation by specialists DriverSource of Houston, Texas. Inspired by the Lancia Stratos, they set about modifying this 1975 Dino 308 GT4 to become a rugged off-road racer, all the while maintaining the original design’s period charm. That angular design suits the off-roading looks down to a tee.</p>

      <p>The list of modifications and enhancements is extensive and includes a raised suspension, custom steel front bumper incorporating quad Hella lamps, whip CB antenna, fiberglass-reinforced mudflaps and a rebuilt steering system. The rear decklid and window casings are wrapped in a satin vinyl evoking memories of the inimitable Stratos.</p>
      <p>The interior features reupholstered seats, period-correct corduroy inserts, Repa four-point seatbelts, fire extinguisher and aluminum pedals. This Dino 308 GT4 is a rare rear seat delete example, it comes with extensive maintenance records including a recent $26,000 service, and it still has its original jack and emergency toolkit.</p>
      <p>It is a genuine numbers matching car, and is listed in the Dino GT4 registry. This one-off machine will be part of Worldwide Auctioneers offerings at the upcoming Riyadh auction in Saudi Arabia taking place on 23 November.</p>
