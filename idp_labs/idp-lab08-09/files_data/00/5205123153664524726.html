      <p>Speaking to the newspaper, Shane revealed how performances are a regular occurrence at the pub and, if anything, he was holding a bit back in the video posted online.</p>
      <p>"If I knew I was being recorded, I would have stepped it up a gear!‚Äù he told <a href="https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/dublin-news/dublin-barman-singing-pub-dirtyoldtown-17272032"><i><b>Dublin Live</b></i></a>.</p>
      <p>"I've played behind the bar a few times and it's been craic. On that particular night it was a good customer's birthday and I brought up my good guitar to play some music for him.</p>
      <p>"There was also a local funeral on in the function room and a few people came into the bar and joined in on the sing song.‚Äù</p>
      <p>Next time you‚Äôre in Dublin, you might want to stop off in The White House ‚Äì you might even be treated to an impromptu performance.</p>
      <p>If you ask nicely, of course.</p>
