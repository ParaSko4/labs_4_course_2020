      <p>VICTORIA - Schools will reopen Monday in the Victoria area after a tentative agreement was reached between support workers and the district.</p>
      <p>Support workers, including education assistants and custodians, at 18 schools in the Saanich district have been on strike over wages since Oct. 28, leaving about 7,000 students out of class.</p>
      <p>The Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 441, which represents the school workers, says the union and School District 63 reached a tentative agreement on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Union members will hold a ratification vote Sunday, but the union says picket lines will come down and schools will reopen Monday in a show of good faith.</p>
      <p>The union says in a statement it will not comment on details of the tentative agreement until after the ratification vote is complete.</p>
      <p>Local CUPE president Dean Coates says the strike has been difficult and the union is pleased to have an agreement the bargaining committee is recommending for acceptance.</p>
