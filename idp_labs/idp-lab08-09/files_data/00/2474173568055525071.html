          <i>Money Diaries</i>
        </a>
        <i>, where we're tackling what might be the last taboo facing modern working women: money. We're asking a cross-section of women how they spend their hard-earned money during a seven-day period – and we're tracking every last penny.</i>
      </p>
      <p>This week: <i>"I moved to New Zealand about eight months ago for a bit of a change. I found a job as a junior doctor in a small hospital in a small town. Overall it has been good but I definitely have moments when I wish I was closer to home and my family. I have flown back once so far and have another trip back planned in a few months. The flights are pretty pricey but it's worth it to see everyone! I have weeks when I want to quit and book a flight home and other weeks (usually when I get to travel lots) when I love it here! </i></p>
      <p>The job is a one-year contract so I will soon have to decide what to do next. The draw of another year is tempting but there are these constant thoughts hanging over me about getting into a training programme back home and deciding to settle down (I hate that phrase). The job is varied and I enjoy it most of the time. It can be stressful when you are on your own on a night shift but you learn when to call for help. And it helps that it pays pretty well here..." </p>
      <p><b>Industry: </b>Healthcare<br/><b>Age: </b>30<br/><b>Location:</b> A small town in New Zealand. <br/><b>Salary:</b> Equivalent of £50,000-£65,000 depending on the month.<br/><b>Paycheque amount:</b> £2,500-£3,000 (depending on extra shifts).<br/><b>Number of housemates:</b> 3 (it's a flatshare).</p>
      <p>
        <b>Monthly Expenses </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Housing:</b> £300 a month which includes all bills.<br/><b>Loan:</b> I think it's about £200 but I have been struggling to pay it back as the loans company won't accept any of the paperwork I send them to say that I'm working abroad!<br/><b>Transport:</b> Car insurance £65 for the year, tax £80 per year. <br/><b>Phone bill:</b> £10 for the monthly rolling top-up.<br/><b>Savings?</b> £1,000. I was never the type to save anything in the UK but having fewer distractions seems to be good for my bank account!<br/><b>Other:</b> Gym £30, Spotify £15 (theoretically split with my family, but only my brother regularly pays me £3 a month). </p>

      <p><b>Day One</b><br/><br/>8.30am: Wake up, grab a coffee and some avo on a pitta and get back into bed with my Kindle. Turn the electric blanket on for a more luxurious morning! These New Zealand houses don't have insulation and in the middle of winter you really need a good reason to get out of bed. <br/><br/>11am: I round up my housemates and head to the golf course. We've been meaning to try out golf for ages as a few of the other junior doctors play (yes, they fit the stereotype). My friends have golf clubs that we share among the five of us and it costs £7.50 per person for nine holes.<br/><br/>11.30am: Realise that despite frequent attempts at mini golf and pitch and putt on holiday, the real deal requires a lot more strength and skill! Still we enjoy ambling in nature and laughing whenever one of our pros messes up. <br/><br/>4.45pm: Buy ingredients for a roast back at ours; my flatmates and I buy a few things each so we share the cost. Mine is £18 for parsnips, pumpkin, broccoli, a few bits for the week and a bottle of shiraz. Still can't get over how expensive New Zealand supermarkets are compared to back home! Especially for fresh food and vegetables. Also fill up with petrol on the way home. £40<br/><br/>8pm: Get back, cook and light a fire and the other golfers join us for an evening in. Sometimes I'm glad to have the company of housemates, other times I really wish I was living on my own. <br/><br/><b>Total: £65.50</b></p>

      <p><b>Day Two</b><br/><br/>6.10am: Wake up with the alarm to news that my good friend has got engaged! Unfortunately I missed the group phone chat as I was sleeping but will try and catch up on the story later. It's not just the weekends away that I miss on the other side of the world. <br/><br/>7.45am: Start new rotation at work today: the medical rotation. Involves a long handover in the morning and an even longer ward round where we see about 12 different medical patients. The consultant talks to the patient and examines while I take notes and change medication prescriptions at his request. This new job is high in paperwork levels.<br/><br/>12.30pm: Free lunch at work (something we don't get in the NHS) of a veggie rice dish, grapes, oranges and a date scone. The food (despite being free) is not particularly good, and so I make the most of the free fruit. <br/><br/>2pm: My consultant lets me do a bone marrow biopsy after lunch. It's good to be able to practise these procedures under close supervision. <br/><br/>6pm: After work I have a sudden craving for falafel so head to the shop to get ingredients and attempt to cook them. End up with a soggy mess and try and salvage with lots of hummus. Not the gourmet meal I had imagined. <br/><br/><b>Total: £14 for my falafel mess </b></p>

      <p><b>Day Three</b><br/><br/>6.20am: Wake a bit later today and really struggle to get out of bed. I'm out of avocados, which doesn't help things. Have a green tea and peanut butter on toast; I brought some back from the UK last time I was there, as there's nothing quite like your favourite peanut butter on toast!<br/><br/>7.45pm: The consultants argue at handover about who should take the new patients who came in overnight. As senior medical staff, you would think they would have better things to do with their time. Round on the patients on my own today, as my consultant has a morning clinic. Dangerous to be left alone, I go to the café to get an almond milk flat white. £2.20<br/><br/>12pm: Free lunch today is mushroom frittata and grapes, apples and a banana for my collection at home.<br/><br/>6pm: Pick up my friends T and E for a workout at the gym. We do a HIIT circuit based on a few of our favourite (subjective) exercises. Battle ropes, medicine balls and box jumps included.<br/><br/>8pm: On the way home we stop for essentials (mainly pitta and avocado – I really need to broaden my palate). Also pick up some miso soup and cabbage. £11<br/><br/>9pm: Cook up a pot of miso soup with cabbage, leek, broccoli, peas and noodles. The greens make me feel good about myself.<br/><br/><b>Total: £13.20</b></p>

      <p><b>Day Four</b><br/><br/>5.30am: Up for a spin class at the gym. It's a good one and I love leaving the gym and watching the sun rise over the Pacific ocean on the way home. <br/><br/>11.30am: Head for an early lunch as I'm starving, consisting of some sort of rice salad with feta. Grab a muffin as I feel like a treat. <br/><br/>2pm: Get to put a drain in a patient this afternoon. We drain just over two litres of fluid from the patient's abdomen. It feels pretty cool!<br/><br/>5.30pm: The procedure sets me back with my regular jobs and I end up scrambling around to get out on time. Run out of the hospital at 6pm and head to an appointment for my cervical smear. I've been meaning to get it done for about six months as I'm due for one in the UK but I kept having to reschedule. Being a non-NZ citizen it will set me back £40. I miss the NHS at times like this.<br/><br/>8pm: Head home for the remains of miso soup and whip up a banana bread as I am working late shift tomorrow.<br/><br/><b>Total: £40</b></p>

      <p><b>Day Five</b><br/><br/>7am: Later start today as I'm covering mental health and they don't start work until 8.30am. <br/><br/>10.30am: During the morning I try and FaceTime with my mum. Currently the UK is 11 hours behind but it's constantly changing and I always get confused. We chat a bit but the Wi-Fi isn't very good and we both get annoyed with having to repeat ourselves a million times. <br/><br/>4pm: On a late shift today so I pick up the crash pager and see the new admissions to the ward. One of the students is keen to learn so we split the jobs. My friend brings in some Vietnamese food for dinner (their treat!) and a few of us head to the mess to eat. I pray my pager doesn't go off, and luck is with me tonight!<br/><br/>10pm: Finish for the day and head home to lie awake in bed for an hour or two before I finally manage to fall asleep as I'm still so wired. <br/><br/><b>Total: £0</b></p>

      <p><b>Day Six</b><br/><br/>7am: Another lie-in for the last day covering mental health. The morning is a bit busier and I don't get over to join the others at the main hospital until 12. Pick up roast veg for lunch and take it outside to the single patch of grass that we have found on the other side of the hospital.<br/><br/>12pm: My friend T and I have a leisurely lunch on what feels like the first day of spring and plan what to do with our free weekend tomorrow. We always try and book an Airbnb somewhere new in order to explore the beautiful South Island scenery. I spot a quaint little vineyard not too far from the mountains and the sea, and after both getting excited about the prospect of wine tasting, I book it. £100 for both of us. We usually take it in turns to pay and don't keep track of payments.<br/><br/>4pm: Finish on the dot and decide to head to the gym for a solo workout. I manage 400 battle ropes, 400 punches and 10 sled pushes before giving in to exhaustion and heading home for a shower. <br/><br/>6.30pm: I go over to a friend's house with some lighter alcohol beers and we share work stories before talking about dinner plans. We head out to the sushi restaurant to meet some friends for dinner. One of them is celebrating a promotion. We order far too much food and I proceed to finish off all the leftovers because it tastes so good. £20 each for dinner. <br/><br/><b>Total: £120</b></p>

      <p><b>Day Seven</b><br/><br/>10am: Waking up to the second day of spring with lots of sunshine, I drive to pick up T and we head to a local village for the farmers' market. We were planning on meeting our friends here but on arriving find out it's only open in summer. To curb our disappointment, we head to the cheese tasting shop to stock up on local cheeses, and I pick up a few other things for our picnic lunch. £12.50<br/><br/>1.30pm: Picnic in hand, we drive 10 minutes down the road to our friend's new plot of land and enjoy the spread of foods! After stuffing our faces until there's no food left, we get out the frisbee for some exercise in the sun. There is a river nearby; it looks too good not to swim. The water is ice cold as it's run off the mountain but the feeling after jumping in is like nothing else, and we go back for seconds.<br/><br/>5pm: Having parted ways with our friends at the river, T and I turn into the gates of the most beautiful little guesthouse we have stayed in so far. The host shares a bottle of their homegrown wine with us on the terrace in the sun as we watch their dog run around the grounds.<br/><br/>6pm: One bottle of wine down, the host brings out a cheese platter (we pay an extra £12.50 for this – worth it!) and we stay outside until the sun sets and the chill sets in.<br/><br/>8pm: Retiring to the warmth of our little guesthouse, we light the fire and try to stay warm. It's days like this when I am happy I made the decision to come here. <br/><br/><b>Total: £25</b></p>

      <p><b>The Breakdown</b><br/><br/>Food/Drink: £90.20<br/>Entertainment: £7.50<br/>Clothes/Beauty: £0<br/>Travel: £40<br/>Other: £140<br/><br/><b>Total: £277.70</b><br/><br/><b>Conclusion</b><br/><br/>"As I expected, I spend the most on food and travel. Despite getting lunch for free.<br/><br/>The best weeks are when I get to see this beautiful country, so I don't mind spending money on this. Also when I convert it back to ££ it doesn't seem as expensive. Maybe I should stop complaining about the price of food!"</p>
