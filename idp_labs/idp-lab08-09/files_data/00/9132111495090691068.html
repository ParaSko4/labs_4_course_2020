      <p>Parents and drivers have been advised to ensure the safety of children onboard their vehicles by keeping them in seat belts.</p>
      <p>The Reverend Ismaila Hansmittson Awudu, the Head Pastor, International Central Gospel Church, East Legon, said children, due to their curious nature, would often stand in vehicles to have a good view of the environs and in the event of a sudden break, the child could be thrown out.</p>
      <p>He said it was better to be cautious to help save the many lives, which were lost to road accidents each year.</p>
      <p>Rev. Awudu, also the Board Chairman of National Road Safety Authority (NRSA), said this when members of the Authority joined in Worship at the Yaweh Temple to mark this year’s “Road Accident Victims Day,” which is observed worldwide on every third Sunday of November.</p>
      <p>The Day is to remember persons who were injured or died through road accidents and pray for their families.</p>
      <p>It is also to sensitise the public on healthy traffic practices. Rev. Awudu said drivers should be more serious with road regulations during the Christmas season to prevent accidents, adding; “Don’t drink and drive and don’t speed. It is better to arrive at your destination late and alive.”</p>
      <p>Mrs May Obiri-Yeboah, the Executive Director, NRSA, said about 2,000 lives were lost to road accidents each year and 1,900 had already been recorded this year.</p>
      <p>She said two major factors contributed to road accidents; disruption and speeding; adding that drivers could be disrupted by an array of activities while on the road.</p>
      <p>She said the use of mobile phones, playing of loud music and eating while driving were activities that made the driver lose focus.</p>
      <p>“Drivers are mandated to drive at 15 to 30 Kilometers per hour within towns and cities and 80 to 100 Kilometers per hour on highways and motorways,” she said.</p>

      <p>Mrs Obiri-Yeboah advised the congregation to obey road safety and traffic regulations and pay attention to other road users, especially pedestrians when driving.</p>
      <p>She expressed the hope that the campaign would help sensitise that public to reduce accidents and save lives.</p>
      <p>Pictures of accident scenes were displayed at the entrance of the Church to bring home the dangers and reality of road crashes.</p>
