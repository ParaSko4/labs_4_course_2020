      <p>The international break provides an ideal window to reflect on the start of the Premier League season and one Irish player has attracted plenty of praise for his efforts so far.</p>
      <p>When former Newcastle United striker and the most prolific goal scorer in Premier League history Alan Shearer was asked to pick his team of the year so far, Sheffield United and Ireland international John Egan made the XI.</p>
      <p>Egan has enjoyed a superb campaign under Chris Wilder. The 27-year old has played 12 matches which includes an average of 5.7 clearances per game and four clean sheets.</p>
      <p>Shearer selected four players from league leaders Liverpool with Andy Robertson, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Fabinho and Sadio Mané all making it. Brendan Rodgers' Leicester City have three players included while Manchester City have just one.</p>

      <p>Per <a href="https://www.whoscored.com/Regions/252/Tournaments/2/Seasons/7811/Stages/17590/PlayerStatistics/England-Premier-League-2019-2020">Whoscored</a>, statically, there are several high ranking Irish defenders so far this season. Newcastle's Ciaran Clark has a rating of 7.23 across five games including two goals. Despite fighting for a place in the team, when he has played Brighton's Shane Duffy also holds a high spot with a rating of 7.05.</p>
