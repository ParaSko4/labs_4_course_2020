      <p>The Ghana Catholic Bishops’ Conference has called on government to treat the growing menace of joblessness among the youth as a national emergency, ABC News can report.</p>
      <p>The Bishops in a communique signed by the president, Most Rev. Philip Naameh issued at the end of their 2019 plenary assembly held in Elmina in the Cape Coast Archdiocese this week, said though government is worth commending on initiatives to provide jobs for the youth in the country, it is expedient that together with other stakeholders, government addresses what it describes as a national security threat immediately.</p>
      <p>’’We would like to commend the many initiatives of successive Governments and the current Government, to address the problem of youth unemployment. In spite of these efforts, there is a steep rise in unemployment. This situation is a veritable national security threat which has to be addressed immediately and urgently with a well-articulated programme,’’</p>
      <p>’’We urge all stakeholders, the Government, Private Sector, Political Parties, Faith Based Organisations and Civil Society Organisations to treat the growing menace of joblessness among our youth as a national emergency and come up with practical and innovative solutions to relieve our young citizens of the lingering stress of persistent unemployment,’’ the Bishops said.</p>
      <p>The prelates have also encouraged the youth to adapt to the growing change in the world and also become innovative to create jobs for themselves and also explore available opportunities.</p>
