      <p>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) - Louisiana’s state government websites and many of its email systems and online operations are shut down, disrupting business and services at state agencies.</p>
      <p>The Division of Administration has stopped all outgoing network traffic for departments that use its technology services office for their computer network operations.</p>
      <p>Division of Administration spokesman Jacques Berry didn’t identify Monday what problem caused the shutdown. He had no estimated time for when the websites and email operations would be restored.</p>

        <p>Berry says nearly every state agency is affected in some way. He says technology services workers shut down all of the network servers and are trying to identify where the problem is.</p>
