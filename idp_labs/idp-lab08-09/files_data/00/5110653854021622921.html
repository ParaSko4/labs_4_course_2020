      <h1>Best fantasy football waiver wire pickups for Week 12</h1>
      <h2>Bo Scarbrough is just another Lions' RB to get excited about on the waiver wire, while Jonathan Williams looks like that late-season pickup who will be leading teams in the fantasy playoffs. See more of the top Week 12 waiver and free agent pickups.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:30:57+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 00:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://twitter.com/billyheyen" target="_blank">@billyheyen</a></address>
      <p>It's time to get excited about a Lions' RB on the Week 12 waiver wire. Where have you heard that before? Oh yeah, Ty Johnson and Tra Carson come to mind. Maybe Bo Scarbrough is different -- after all, he's got that Alabama pedigree. At least Scarbrough isn't the only guy worthy of a high waiver claim this week. With Marlon Mack (right hand) out indefinitely, backup Jonathan Williams is definitely worth a top claim -- something that has beenlacking in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>There are a few top-tier quarterback streaming options for you below, too. Patrick Mahomes is on bye in Week 12 (along with Philip Rivers, Kirk Cousins, and Kyler Murray), so you might need one of them. Baker Mayfield (owned in just 54 percent of Yahoo leagues) should have solid scoring chances against the Dolphins, who were just torched by Josh Allen. And Sam Darnold and the Jets' offense are flying right now, which likely won't slow down against Oakland.</p>
      <p>If you need a wide receiver or tight end, you might be best off remembering two players who were disregarded due to byes in Week 11: WR Darius Slayton, who had two scores before the Giants' bye and looks like a solid No. 2 WR for New York, and TE Jacob Hollister, who has scored three touchdowns over the past two games. You also have David Njoku eligible to return from the IR on Week 12, making him a good option against the Dolphins.</p>
      <p>Of course, it wouldn't be the waiver wire report without D/ST streaming options, too. Cleveland could have a great game against Miami, even without Myles Garrett, and it seems like a safe bet that the Lions will have chances to make plays against the Redskins and Dwayne Haskins.</p>
      <p>Be sure to check back here leading into your mid-week waiver claims as we adjust the list to account for Monday Night Football and early-week injury news.</p>

      <h3>#1<br/>Jonathan Williams, RB, Colts</h3>
      <p>Taking over in the second half for an injured Marlon Mack (hand), Williams ran all over the Jaguars, totaling 116 yards on the ground (13 carries) and another 31 through the air (one target). It's unclear how long Mack will be out, but after fracturing his right hand, it will be at least several games Williams figures to start for the foreseeable future, making him a priority pickup in all leagues. --<i>Matt Lutovsky</i></p>

      </figure>
      <h3>#2<br/>Bo Scarbrough, RB, Lions</h3>
      <p>Even with Ty Johnson active, Scarbrough started and received 14 carries in Week 11, leading the team comfortably. He picked up 56 yards and a score, generally looking solid (though he wasn't targeted in the receiving game). The Lions are as unpredictable as any team with their backfield, but at this point, Scarbrough is as good a bet as any to be the team's featured back going forward. Detroit isn't a great running team, but Scarbrough has plenty of touchdown upside in standard leagues. --<i>ML</i></p>

        <figcaption>SN/Getty</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>#3<br/>Derrius Guice, RB, Redskins</h3>
      <p>We didn't have high hopes for Guice this week, but after a slow start playing behind Adrian Peterson, he took advantage of garbage time, catching a screen pass and taking it 45 yards to the house. It was Guice's only reception of the game (two targets). He added 24 rushing yards on seven carries -- two fewer carries than Peterson but only one less yard. Guice will likely continue to split touches with Peterson in the short term, but it would make sense for him to gradually earn more playing over the next few weeks. He's worth owning, as his schedule is highly favorable going forward, especially in Weeks 14 (Packers) and 16 (Giants). --<i>ML</i></p>

      </figure>
      <h3>#4<br/>Deebo Samuel, WR, 49ers</h3>
      <p>Even with Emmanuel Sanders active, Samuel was the 49ers top receiver for the second straight week. All told, he hauled in eight-of-10 targets for 133 yards -- his second straight 100-yard game. Samuel is owned in 53 percent of Yahoo leagues, so he might not be available in your league, but if he is, he's worth a claim.<i>- ML</i></p>

        <figcaption>SN/Getty</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>#5<br/>Randall Cobb, WR, Cowboys</h3>
      <p>Cobb caught four passes for 115 yards and a long touchdown Sunday. It's his third straight game with at least seven targets, making him a usable fantasy piece of what's continued to be a solid passing attack in Dallas. The Cowboys do face the Patriots in Week 12, though, so beware.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>#6<br/>Jacob Hollister, TE, Seahawks</h3>
      <p>Hollister caught three touchdowns in two games before the bye, and you should take advantage of any drops that happened because of that week off. He's starting to grow into the Will Dissly-role in Seattle's offense quite nicely.</p>

        <figcaption>Getty Images</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>#7<br/>Ryan Griffin, TE, Jets</h3>
      <p>Griffin only had one catch in Week 10, but three of his past four weeks have been productive fantasy days, including over 100 yards and a touchdown grab in Week 11. The Jets take on Oakland in Week 12, one of the best matchups for tight ends. Sam Darnold has relied on Griffin enough that maybe you can, too.</p>

        <figcaption>SN/Getty</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>#8<br/>Trey Edmunds, RB, Steelers</h3>
      <p>Pittsburgh gets the Bengals in Week 12, which is a great matchup for Edmunds as the probable early-down guy alongside Jaylen Samuels with James Conner (shoulder) hurting. It's not exciting, but it's pretty much guaranteed 10 touches against the worst run defense in the league if Conner is out.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>#9<br/>David Njoku, TE, Browns</h3>
      <p>Njoku (wrist) is slated to return from Injured Reserve in Week 12 and will return to being a borderline fantasy starter for Cleveland going forward. The Browns also play the Dolphins in Week 12 -- what fun!</p>

        <figcaption>SN/Getty</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>#10<br/>Darius Slayton, WR, Giants</h3>
      <p>Slayton caught two touchdowns before the Giants' Week 11 bye. He's positioned himself as a FLEX option every week going forward as long as Sterling Shepard (concussion) is out.</p>

        <figcaption>Getty Images</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>#11<br/>Kalen Ballage, RB, Dolphins</h3>
      <p>Ballage had 14 touches on Sunday and gained 17 yards. That's awful, yet Miami keeps giving him the ball (including five catches which help in PPR). He also found the end zone. His upside is limited, but at least he's getting touches.</p>

        <figcaption>SN/Getty</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>#12<br/>James Washington, WR, Steelers</h3>
      <p>Both JuJu Smith-Schuster and Diontae Johnson have concussions, so Washington is in a position to see a ton of targets in Week 12 against the Bengals. He's already been trending upward, too, so he's worth a pickup, especially if you own the other two.</p>

        <figcaption>Getty Images</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>#13<br/>Taylor Gabriel, WR, Bears</h3>
      <p>Gabriel has seen consistent snaps the past few weeks, and he led the Bears in targets in Week 11. Week 12 brings a high favorable matchup against the Giants, making Gabriel a worthwhile WR3 streamer, at least in PPR leagues. --<i>ML</i></p>

        <figcaption>SN/Getty</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>#14<br/>Hunter Renfrow, WR, Raiders</h3>
      <p>Renfrow has four straight weeks with at least four catches and gets to face the Jets in Week 12, giving him a solid PPR floor.</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>SN/Getty</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>#15<br/>Russell Gage, WR, Falcons</h3>
      <p>Gage only had four targets in Week 11, but one of those was a touchdown overturned on replay that Gage might've had. You've gotta like the matchup with Tampa Bay in Week 12, and Gage plays a high majority of Atlanta snaps, so he'll be usable.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>#16<br/>Devin Funchess, WR, Colts</h3>
      <p>Funchess (clavicle) is eligible to return from Injured Reserve and could have a week or two of elevated fantasy relevance if T.Y. Hilton (calf) remains out.</p>
      <hr/>

      </figure>
      <h3>#17<br/>Robby Anderson, WR, Jets</h3>
      <p>Anderson caught a touchdown Sunday and gets the phenomenal matchup against Oakland in Week 12. He's a serious boom-or-bust play, but sometimes he booms.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Note: Anderson is 53-percent owned in Yahoo leagues.</i>

        <figcaption>SN/Getty</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>#18<br/>Noah Fant, TE, Broncos</h3>
      <p>Fant was targeted 11 times Sunday and has grown into a bigger piece of the Denver offense as the season has gone on. He only caught four of those for 60 yards, but the usage is the aspect more likely to remain consistent here for the rookie.</p>

        <figcaption>SN/Getty</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>#19<br/>Tyler Eifert, TE, Bengals</h3>
      <p>The Steelers' defense has been strong, but Ryan Finley keeps throwing short and TE is a weakness if Pittsburgh has one. Eifert is a deep streamer for Week 12 if you're in trouble with Travis Kelce or Hunter Henry on bye.</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://images.daznservices.com/di/library/sporting_news/d6/fc/benjamin-watson-102119-getty-ftr_1d5i5c4bocibh1i19mpmgmqhvt.jpg?t=-231144163&amp;quality=80&amp;w=1280"/>
        <figcaption>Getty Images</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>#20<br/>Benjamin Watson, TE, Patriots</h3>
      <p>Tom Brady looked Watson's way a number of times Sunday against Philadelphia, and the matchup gets better in Week 12 against the TE-friendly Cowboys. The ceiling isn't huge here, but it's not a bad option to have if you're a Travis Kelce or Hunter Henry owner.</p>
      <hr/>

        <figcaption>Getty Images</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>#21<br/>Baker Mayfield, QB, Browns</h3>
      <p>Mayfield managed to throw for two touchdowns and run for another on Thursday night despite not looking overly impressive. With a Week 12 matchup with the Dolphins on tap, he's a prime stream for Patrick Mahomes and Philip Rivers' owners. (Mayfield is owned in 54 percent of Yahoo leagues.)</p>

        <figcaption>Getty Images</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>#22<br/>Jacoby Brissett, QB, Colts</h3>
      <p>Brissett threw for one touchdown and ran for another Sunday. His ownership should rise back above 50 percent ahead of a Thursday night meeting with a Texans defense that Lamar Jackson just torched.</p>

        <figcaption>Getty Images</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>#23<br/>Sam Darnold, QB, Jets</h3>
      <p>The Jets' offense is firing on all cylinders, and Darnold threw for nearly 300 yards with four touchdowns in Week 11. New York takes on Oakland at home in Week 12, another great matchup for an offense that's working right now.</p>

        <figcaption>Getty Images</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>#24<br/>Nick Foles, QB, Jaguars</h3>
      <p>Foles looked healthy and maintained a strong connection with DJ Chark, so if you owned Foles at the start of the year or were relying on Gardner Minshew, it seems fair to trust Foles now (especially ahead of a friendly fantasy playoff schedule).</p>

      <h3>#26<br/>Denver Broncos D/ST</h3>
      <p>Denver might have the best defense of our D/ST streamers, and Week 12 opponent Josh Allen is turnover-prone at times.</p>

      <h3>#27<br/>Detroit Lions D/ST</h3>
      <p>Until Dwayne Haskins starts looking like he's ready for the NFL, defenses against him continue to be stream candidates, as the Lions are in Week 12. The Redskinshadn't scored a touchdown in 17 quarters before scoring late on Sunday.</p>

      <h3>#29<br/>Oakland Raiders D/ST</h3>
      <p>Sam Darnold is turnover-prone, and Le'Veon Bell keeps getting hurt. If Oakland can capitalize on those things, it can be a productive Week 12 for the Raiders.</p>
