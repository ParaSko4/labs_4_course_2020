              <h3>U.S. senator backs banking law for cannabis businesses</h3>
              <p>Maine’s independent federal U.S. senator says it’s time for the federal government to update banking laws to reflect the rise of legal hemp and cannabis businesses. Sen. Angus King represents a state where legal adult use marijuana sales are likely to begin in early 2020. He says the U.S. Senate should protect those businesses by passing the Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking Act. King says the bill would make certain that legal hemp and cannabis businesses can have access to the same financial services as any other businesses. He says it’s important for states that have legalized medical and recreational marijuana. King said the changes would also benefit hemp farmers who “have done everything right” but still lack access to financial services. The proposal has already passed the House of Representatives.</p>

                <h3>Acreage to acquire New Jersey medical operator</h3>
                <p>Acreage Holdings, Inc. said it has entered into an agreement to acquire 100 per cent of Compassionate Care Foundation, Inc., a New Jersey vertically integrated cannabis nonprofit corporation. Acreage says CCF’s vertically integrated operations include licenses for cultivation, manufacturing and processing, and three retail dispensaries. “I’m thrilled to finally welcome CCF into the Acreage family,” said Kevin Murphy, chairman and CEO of Acreage. “This reorganization will result in increased access to affordable medical cannabis for New Jersey’s existing patients in short order. Moreover, we have long believed that upon adult-use legalization, the New England and Mid-Atlantic regions will be the preeminent cannabis market in the U.S. and Acreage is best positioned of any U.S. cannabis company to benefit.”</p>
