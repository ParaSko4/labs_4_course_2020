      <p>Thanks to a brilliant free kick from Luis Suarez and a late penalty from Lionel Messi, Argentina drew 2-2 with Uruguay in an interesting Rio de la Plata Clasico contested in Tel Aviv. Here’s what we learned from the tie. <b>There was not much to speak of in the first 15 minutes, but Messi and Dybala started finding one another</b></p>
      <p>It has been said that the pair can’t play together, yet in a 4-3-1-2, Dybala was put behind Messi and Sergio Aguero in a central attacking midfield role. The Juventus star started to have some success charging forward and/or heading to the wing while Messi dropped back. And this was where Argentina were most threatening in the opening quarter of an hour.</p>
      <p>Around 20 minutes in, he dinked around two Uruguayan players in the box but couldn’t find anyone with his dangerous low-driven cross.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Then Uruguay came alive</b>
      </p>
      <p>Matias Vecino embarked on a similar run as Dybala’s and linked with Suarez, who hit it with the outside of his foot but was blocked by Nicolas Tagliafico in what was the best chance of the match up to that point.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Argentina started to switch it to the wings</b>
      </p>
      <p>As Messi and Dybala tried to bring Tagliafico more into the game, some threatenting crosses began to fly in from the left flank for Aguero.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Uruguay’s young midfield connected perfectly and beautifully with its veteran attack to put them 0-1 ahead</b>
      </p>
      <p>Real Madrid crack Fede Valverde slotted it cooly across the edge of the box to Lucas Torreira, who then chipped a lovely ball over for Luis Suarez to find Edinson with a one touch knock the PSG matador crisply converted. Nearing their 33rd birthdays, the pair are still one of the most explosive strike duos in world soccer. That was Cavani’s 50th goal for the tiny South American nation and they are the only two to have reached such a milestone.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Dybala almost equalised shortly after</b>
      </p>
      <p>But he was deemed to have handballed as it dropped to him when smashing home from close range.</p>
      <p>
        <b>It started getting spicy out there</b>
      </p>
      <p>Even in a friendly, it is always a rough affair between these two and Cavani was booked seconds before Vecino also picked up a yellow around the 40th minute. Then, Cavani fouled Dybala this time and in a more competitive match might have already been sent for an early bath. Likewise for Vecino, who slid in on Messi two minutes later.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Messi had a dead ball chance from Messi range</b>
      </p>
      <p>Best friend Suarez ordered his teammates into some sort of wall defence, but thankfully for the Uruguayans Martín Campaña guessed right and was there to dive and catch it. Down the tunnel Argentina went, trailing by a goal to nil.</p>
      <p>
        <b>It was almost second time lucky</b>
      </p>
      <p>At the beginning of the second half. But again Campaña kept it out with a low dive. Argentina started with a lot more urgency than they had the first half, though, it must be noted.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cavani was brought off for Laxalt</b>
      </p>
      <p>Most probably as a precaution in the 56th minute. As mentioned, the goalscorer was already on a yellow and the AC Milan left-back coming on paved the way to a tactical shift from Oscar Tabarez. A strange move nonetheless.</p>
      <p>
        <b>It seemed like it wasn’t to be Sergio Aguero’s night</b>
      </p>
      <p>Given the nod over Lautaro Martinez, it seemed that the Manchester City target man had done little to help his case. With all the hallmarks of a classic striker, however, the Manchester City target man who had been pedestrian for an hour headed in Messi’s swinging free kick from to set up a potentially-thrilling last 30 minutes.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Suarez showed Messi how it was done</b>
      </p>
      <p>Learning from the best, he put La Celeste 1-2 ahead with a delicious free kick Messi would be proud of that. Flying into the top left corner, the effort knocked Esteban Andrada into the back of his own net.</p>
      <p>
        <b>This was one of Dybala’s greatest games in an Argentina shirt</b>
      </p>
      <p>He was his team’s best player and gave Lionel Scaloni food for thought movin forward. In the 76th minute however, the coach wanted to see how Martinez and Aguero could work together and brought the Inter striker on to play the final quarter of an hour.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Messi salvaged a draw with his penalty</b>
      </p>
      <p>Aguero having his header brilliantly denied by Campaña near the death, he won a penalty shortly after once Martin Caceres handled it in stoppage time. Making no mistake, LM10 cooly rolled it into the bottom right corner to make it 2-2.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The result and tour overall will give Messi and Argentina something to think about</b>
      </p>
      <p>Unbeaten in their two November matches after also beating Brazil, Messi’s return has been an undoubted success with two goals and assist and the future looks bright for Argentina heading to the Copa America.</p>
      <p>They challenged one of the best teams on the continent, and in the world for that matter, to the very last here. If they can master the right blend of youth and experience, a first major international trophy may finally beckon for the FC Barcelona icon.</p>
