      <p>China's central bank unexpectedly trimmed a key interbank lending rate on Monday, the first easing in the liquidity tool in more than four years and a signal to markets that policymakers are ready to act to prop up slowing growth.</p>
      <p>The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said on its website that it was lowering the seven-day reverse repurchase rate to 2.50% from 2.55%.</p>
      <p>The move cheered China's bond market and comes just two weeks after the PBOC cut the borrowing cost on its medium-term lending facility (MLF) loans by the same margin.</p>

      <p>Analysts say the unexpected cut on Monday shows the central bank is keen to ease investor worries that higher inflation will prevent it from delivering fresh stimulus measures.</p>
      <p>Zhou Hao, economist at Commerzbank in Singapore said the reverse repo rate cut indicates a policy change in coming months, including "some fine-tuning to prioritise the pro-growth policy for the time being."</p>
      <p>Driven by soaring pork prices from the spread of African Swine Fever, China's consumer inflation rose past the government's target of around 3% in October to its fastest pace in almost eight years, posing a dilemma for the PBOC.</p>
      <p>"I expected an easing move from the PBOC, just didn't know when," said a Hong Kong-based portfolio manager. "The (high) Consumer Price Index (CPI) was only pig CPI. Everything else is in big trouble."</p>
      <p>He noted that the central bank continues to take a cautious approach to easing. In a report released Saturday, the PBOC said it would maintain prudent monetary policy to prevent inflation from spreading.</p>
      <p>Markets participants widely believe the two rate cuts in the open market operations suggest a similar adjustment in its newly established Loan Prime Rate.</p>
      <p>The PBOC will announce its monthly LPR fixing on Wednesday. The rate on the one-year fixing now stands at 4.2% while the five-year is at 4.85%.</p>
      <p>The rate cut bolstered the bond market on Monday morning, with China's benchmark 10-year treasury futures for December delivery were up more than 0.4%.</p>
      <p>The PBOC has skipped reverse repo operations for 15 straight trading days before the resumption on Monday, when it injected 180 billion yuan ($25.74 billion) into the interbank market.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
