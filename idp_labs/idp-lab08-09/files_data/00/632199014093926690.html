      <p>Mitsubishi has revealed the facelifted Mirage ahead of its UK launch early next year.</p>
      <p>The revisions give the brand’s smallest car a sharper and more dynamic exterior as well as more elegant interior designs.</p>
      <p>It adopts the ‘dynamic shield’ front design, as seen on the Outlander and new L200.</p>
      <p>New LED headlights give the car an improved road presence and, combined with its new grille, the Mirage looks more aggressive than before.</p>
      <p>Visibility is also improved, thanks to the multi-bulb units.</p>

      <p>The rear is also given a wider and more beefed-up look with a new squared-off bumper and L-signature horizontal LED combination lamps.</p>
      <p>Finishing off the car’s new look are 15-inch alloy wheels with two-tone diamond-cut styling. Customers can also choose from two new colour choices: White Diamond and Sand Yellow.</p>
      <p>Interior quality and comfort has been lifted with soft-touch trim pieces, improved decorative trims and synthetic level upper dash panels.</p>

      <p>A redesigned front arm rest gives greater functionality and the seats have been upgraded with new piping and stitching.</p>
      <p>When it goes on sale, the new Mirage will be available with Mitsubishi’s new Smartphone Display Audio (SDA) system with a seven-inch touchscreen. The SDA system offers full smartphone connectivity including Bluetooth hands-free calling and both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.</p>
      <p>It is expected that the existing 1.2-litre petrol engine will be carried over into facelift models</p>
      <p>Final UK specification has not been confirmed yet but will be announced closer to the launch of the new Mitsubishi Mirage in early 2020.</p>
      <p>The current Mirage is priced between £9,999 and £11,999.</p>
