      <h1>Bach says opponents of Olympic marathon move wanted an edge</h1>

      <p>LONDON (AP) - Athletes who opposed moving the Olympic marathons and race walks from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tokyo/">Tokyo</a> to the northern city of Sapporo wanted a competitive edge, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/international-olympic-committee/">IOC</a> President Thomas Bach said Monday.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/international-olympic-committee/">International Olympic Committee</a> decided last month to move the races to Sapporo because <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tokyo/">Tokyo</a> would be too hot in August. Although the decision was angrily opposed by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tokyo/">Tokyo</a>’s governor and some competitors, Bach said the “vast majority of athletes” back the move.</p>
      <p>“There are one or two voices of athletes who think they would be better prepared for races in heat than the others and wanted to benefit from this,” Bach said in London at event to announce a new Olympic sponsor. “But the responsibility of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/international-olympic-committee/">IOC</a> is to take care of the health of all athletes and to make it possible for all athletes, if ever possible, to complete the race.</p>
      <p>“There have been consultations before, despite all the rumors going on, so we are really pleased with this decision because it is in the interest of the athletes and then also in the end the overall interest of the Olympic Games, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tokyo/">Tokyo</a> 2020.”</p>
      <p>Also Monday, Tokyo Olympic organizers said a looped course - starting and finishing in Sapporo’s Odori Park - is being considered for the events.</p>

      <p>Any plan will have to be approved by the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/international-olympic-committee/">IOC</a>, likely at an executive board meeting in December.</p>
      <p>“While a loop-designed course was discussed during the meeting, the course details are still under discussion,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tokyo/">Tokyo</a> organizers said.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/international-olympic-committee/">IOC</a> abruptly announced the marathon and race walk changes last month, fearing <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tokyo/">Tokyo</a>’s summer heat could produce TV images like those seen in Doha, Qatar, during the world track championships.</p>
      <p>Despite a midnight start, dozens of runners collapsed on the marathon course in Doha. Some were carried away on stretchers, and others rode wheelchairs to ambulances.</p>

        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/international-olympic-committee/">IOC</a> has rejected starting the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tokyo/">Tokyo</a> races at dawn, as organizers proposed.</p>
        <p>“This decision with the marathon and the race walking was based on scientific advice we got from a working group, which we have established already last year, which is addressing all these challenges,” Bach said. “They clearly told us that the most exposed events would be the marathon and the race walk.”</p>
        <p>The men’s marathon was originally scheduled for Aug. 9, the final day of the Olympics, and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/international-olympic-committee/">IOC</a> officials have said they prefer to keep that date.</p>
        <p>Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike and her allies have said the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/international-olympic-committee/">IOC</a> was inconsistent since it had known about <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tokyo/">Tokyo</a>’s heat since the games were awarded in 2013. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/international-olympic-committee/">IOC</a> has also repeatedly praised <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tokyo/">Tokyo</a>’s preparations to deal with the heat.</p>
