      <h1>Alabama’s Tua Tagovailoa taking first step in long recovery</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:10:25+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 00:10</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Staszewski</a></address>
      <p>Tua Tagovailoa will have surgery now that his season is over.</p>
      <p>The Alabama star quarterback, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/tua-tagovailoa-injury-could-be-devastating-for-his-nfl-draft-stock/">who dislocated his hip</a> in a win over Mississippi State on Saturday, will have surgery Monday in Houston, Alabama’s orthopedic surgeon <a href="https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1196208384653090816">said in a statement Sunday.</a></p>
      <p>The unsurprising decision comes after Dr. Lyle Cain and his staff spent the past 24 hours consulting with “multiple orthopedic experts across the country, who specialize in hip injuries and surgeries.”</p>
      <p>Hours after the injury, it was announced Tagovailoa would miss the rest of the season <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/tua-tagovailoas-injury-dashes-more-than-alabamas-dreams/">in a blow to Alabama’s title hopes.</a></p>
      <p>Tagovailoa was expected to be a potential No. 1 pick in the upcoming NFL draft, but the injury could put that in doubt or even push him to return to Alabama next season.</p>
