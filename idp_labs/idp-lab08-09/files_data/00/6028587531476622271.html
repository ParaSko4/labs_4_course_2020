      <p>N’Keal Harry stepped on for the second offensive snap Sunday night at Lincoln Financial Field.The wide receiver, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverthomas/2019/04/26/patriots-break-first-round-barrier-with-arizona-state-wideout-nkeal-harry/#4cfa39e21507">drafted No. 32 overall</a> by the New England Patriots in April, did so to block.</p>
      <p>And block Harry continued to do on the second, third and fourth play of his NFL career. It made sense as to why.</p>
      <p>More so after the Arizona State product did some jarring with Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills. Even more so after Harry, listed at 6-foot-4 and 225 pounds, sent defensive end Derek Barnett to the grass on a crack toss to Patriots running back Sony Michel.</p>
      <p>But Harry got tossed the football, too.</p>
      <p>With under 12 minutes to go before halftime, No. 15 moved the chains on a play-action slant route <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverthomas/2019/10/24/josh-gordons-worthwhile-route-with-the-patriots-reportedly-nears-its-end/#59da5c7754cf">reminiscent</a> of current Seattle Seahawk Josh Gordon. The pass and catch sent Harry underneath Philadelphia corner Ronald Darby for a gain of 11 yards and a fresh set of downs.</p>
      <p>Harry finished with three receptions for 18 yards from quarterback Tom Brady. He was targeted on four occasions. He played north of 30 offensive snaps.</p>
      <p>His role ultimately expanded after fellow New England wideout Phillip Dorsett departed with a concussion. But on the field was Harry for the two-point conversion that put the Patriots up by a score of 17-10. And on the field the Sun Devil would remain to catch a screen pass, jump back to force a missed tackle, and pick up four yards.</p>
      <p>New England’s war room had never before drafted a wide receiver in the first round under head coach Bill Belichick.</p>
      <p>Sunday was a start for the rookie. One with a four-year, $10.098 million deal featuring a $5.53 million signing bonus. It brought a little of everything. Perhaps more than what was expected in a game that brought the Patriots to 9-1 on the regular season.</p>

      <p>Harry saw his preseason conclude after three reps and two receptions versus the Detroit Lions in the August opener.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverthomas/2019/10/15/the-clock-begins-to-tick-for-patriots-first-round-pick-nkeal-harry/#510aec0127f1">began practicing</a> once again on Oct. 15. Then, prior to New England’s matchup with the Baltimore Ravens to begin November, Harry found himself activated from injured reserve and onto a depth chart that includes the aforementioned Dorsett, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverthomas/2019/11/11/julian-edelmans-spring-extension-with-patriots-has-been-met-by-a-career-autumn/#ccc26c46d8c3">the extended</a> Julian Edelman, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverthomas/2019/10/22/patriots-deem-wide-receiver-mohamed-sanu-worth-the-asking-price/#72fcdf333bc3">trade acquisition</a> Mohamed Sanu, captain Matthew Slater and undrafted rookies in Jakobi Meyers and Gunner Olszewski.</p>
      <p>But not until the trip to Philadelphia did Harry find himself among the actives.</p>
      <p>The X-receiver then provided his quarterback with a safety valve on a curl that proved to be a better option than a sack.</p>
      <p>Harry also lined up at the flanker. He also lined up in the slot. He also lined up off the edge of New England’s punt returns to rush after the right leg of the Eagles’ Cameron Johnston.</p>
      <p>So, what can Harry bring? The Patriots provided a brief answer in usage more than words on Sunday. More involvement in the red zone could follow next weekend against the Dallas Cowboys.</p>
      <p>But the 18 receiving yards told only part of it for the top seed in the AFC.</p>
