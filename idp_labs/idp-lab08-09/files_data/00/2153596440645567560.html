      <h1>What to expect from Takealot on Black Friday 2019 – including a week of early deals</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://businesstech.co.za/news/author/staff-writer/" target="_blank">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>Online retailer Takealot has outlined its plans for Black Friday 2019 – including an early sale.</p>
      <p>Set to fall on 29 November, Black Friday marks the start of the festive season for many retailers and has proven to be a record-breaking sales day for both Takealot and Superbalist.</p>
      <p>Takealot said that its ‘Blue Dot Sale’ will run over a five day period starting on Black Friday (29 November).</p>
      <p>It will see a range of new deals throughout the weekend as well as on Cyber Monday (2 December) and Takealot Tuesday (3 December) with up to 60% off thousands of items.</p>
      <p>For the first time, Takealot said it will also be giving their shoppers exclusive early access to some of its Black Friday deals starting on the <b>24 November</b>.</p>
      <p>The group said that these early-access deals will be heavily discounted and will <b>not see further price cuts</b> when the actual Black Friday sale starts.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Plans </b>
      </p>
      <p>Takealot CEO Kim Reid said that this year he is anticipating the biggest Black Friday yet, a culmination of months of tech and operational business-wide focus to prepare for increased predicted traffic and shopper volumes.</p>
      <p>Takealot’s Black Friday gross merchandise value (GMV) grew 125% from 2017 to 2018, with orders up 127%. Superbalist’s Black Friday GMV has grown on average around 50%.</p>
      <p>Reid says throughout the year they have been working to scale operations across multiple areas within the business.</p>
      <p>“After expanding our Johannesburg distribution centre (DC), our warehouse storage space now stands at 75 000m 2 . We house over 3.7 million items at any given time, and have opened 47 Takealot Pickup Points in the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, Gauteng, Kwa-Zulu Natal, Limpopo, Free State and Mpumalanga for order collections and returns, with more to open in the coming months.”</p>
      <p>The Takealot group anticipates they’ll travel over 4 million km from Black Friday until 24 December. “To put that in context, it is the equivalent of circumnavigating the globe over 100 times” said Reid.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Superbalist </b>
      </p>
      <p>Superbalist’s Showdown sale will run from the 29 November to 3 December with up to 70% off more than 15 000+ items.</p>
      <p>The groups said that Superbalist shoppers will also have early access to Black Friday deals on selected days throughout November with Superbalist’s Black Friday Spoilers.</p>
      <p>These 24 hours to shop deals also won’t be beaten on Black Friday, it said.</p>
