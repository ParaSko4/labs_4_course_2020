      <p>According to recently <a href="https://www.acog.org/Clinical-Guidance-and-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Gynecologic-Practice/Access-to-Hormonal-Contraception">updated recommendations</a> published by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), women should be able to access several different hormonal contraceptives over-the-counter (OTC), and not just oral contraceptives.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/918946">Regulatory</a> action by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is required to make hormonal contraceptives, including the birth control pill, available OTC. The process of prescription to OTC switches relies heavily on evidence from safety and effectiveness studies concerning the prescription-only product. Also, consumer studies, including label comprehension, are prerequisites to evaluate the “OTC-ness” of switch candidates. Here, the pertinent clinical questions include whether the product is safe and effective for consumers under conditions of actual use, whether there is a need for physician evaluation or monitoring, and the nature and severity of potential adverse effects associated with the product.</p>
      <p>On the whole, hormonal contraceptives pass the OTC-ness tests. Research has demonstrated that women can successfully use <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2615461/">self-screening tools</a> with relative accuracy to determine whether oral contraceptives are appropriate for them. This also appears to apply in the more difficult cases, such as the use of depot <a href="https://reference.medscape.com/drug/depo-provera-depo-subq-provera-104-medroxyprogesterone-342782">medroxyprogesterone</a> acetate, which requires that a woman be taught to self-administer subcutaneous injections.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, self-screening is not without limitations, particularly with respect to the ability to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2615461/">assess for contraindications</a>.</p>
      <p>Not all women are appropriate candidates for hormonal contraceptives. For example, there are contraindications for certain women with cancer, diabetes, and hypertension, among other diseases.</p>
      <p>The economic advantages of OTC availability pertain to access, convenience, and cost to many consumers. For those who lack insurance or are underinsured, for example, OTC contraceptives will likely be more affordable in two ways. They will no longer incur out-of-pocket costs for physician visits. And, OTC products tend to be cheaper than prescription-only products.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/918946">ACOG’s Committee</a> on Gynecologic Practice, “over-the-counter access to hormonal contraception will improve availability, but it should not be at the expense of affordability. Insurance coverage and other financial support for contraception should still apply.”</p>
      <p>The problem here is that insurance coverage of both prescription-only and OTC contraceptives may become less likely over time, especially in light of recent <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/new-regulations-broadening-employer-exemptions-to-contraceptive-coverage-impact-on-women/">regulatory moves</a> by the Trump Administration to significantly broaden employers’ ability to be exempt from the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) contraceptive coverage requirement.</p>
      <p>Across <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0084088">therapeutic categories</a>, while insurers tend to cover most prescription-only products, they usually balk at paying for OTC products unless faced with legal mandates requiring coverage. So, as exemptions to the ACA’s contraceptive coverage requirements increase, insured consumers stand to pay more out of pocket.</p>
      <p>On balance, switching hormonal contraceptives OTC improves availability for many, particularly the un- and underinsured. But, it’s important to keep in mind the above caveats regarding contraindications in certain instances and increased out-of-pocket costs for some.</p>
