      <p>On Sunday, Kanye West took to Twitter to announce an opera. It’s titled, “Nebuchadnezzar” and will be performed at the Hollywood Bowl on November 24th, at 4pm. The announcement notes, “Music with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/officiallythesamples/?hl=en">Sunday Service</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4t3KZlAPoa/">Peter Collins</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVmPQwmu5gg">Infinities Song</a>*” As of right now, we don’t know what this opera will entail. The most obvious question some may have, though, is: why Nebuchadnezzar? And, maybe, <i>who</i> is Nebuchadnezzar?</p>
      <p>
        <b>Who</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nebuchadnezzar is a real person. One of the more famous kings of ancient Babylon, ruling for over 40 years, from about 605 BC to 562 BC. He features in the Bible, specifically the Book of Daniel, chapters 1, 2, 3, and 4.</p>
      <p>In the <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+1&amp;version=NIV">first chapter</a>, Nebuchadnezzar is a distant figure. The conquering king who seizes Jerusalem. Daniel, esteemed for his perception and wisdom, is one of several Israelites chosen to serve the new king.</p>
      <p>In the <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+2&amp;version=NIV">second chapter</a>, Daniel’s put to the test, as Nebuchadnezzar has had an awful dream and wants someone to interpret it. Unfortunately, the king won’t tell anyone what his dream was. He expects one of his many “magicians, enchanters, sorcerers and astrologers to tell him what he had dream.” Then he wants the meaning. Unfortunately for Nebuchadnezzar, no one can possibly do that. While the king’s ready to sentence them all to death, Daniel, that very night, has a vision.</p>
      <p>Armed with his vision, our hero visits Nebuchadnezzar and reveals the dream and the interpretation. The king, so impressed, praises Daniel’s God, the God of the Israelites.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+3&amp;version=NIV">Chapter three</a> finds Nebuchadnezzar in another violent mood. The king has had his herald announce, “Nations and peoples of every language, this is what you are commanded to do: As soon as you hear the sound of the horn..., you must fall down and worship the image of gold** that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up. Whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace.”</p>
      <p>A trio of Daniel’s friends, and fellow Israelites, refuse to worship the false idol. When confronted by the king, they explain that their God will save them. Nebuchadnezzar, enraged, has them thrown into his furnace’s inferno. Lo and behold: the three men survive. Not only that, Nebuchadnezzar perceives an angel guarding them. Amazed, the king has the men removed from the furnace. Once again, the story ends with Nebuchadnezzar praising the God of the Israelites as opposed to his own set of deities.</p>
      <p>Lastly, in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+4&amp;version=NIV">chapter four</a>, Nebuchadnezzar has another dream. This time, it’s of a giant tree that provides sustenance and protection for the land and animals. But a holy messenger says the tree must be cut down. Then someone was to be sent away to live in the wild, his mind replaced with that of an animal. As the king describes it: “‘The decision is announced by messengers, the holy ones declare the verdict, so that the living may know that the Most High is sovereign over all kingdoms on earth and gives them to anyone he wishes and set over them the lowliest of people.”</p>
      <p>Daniel returns to the role of interpreter, explaining to the king that the dream is about the king. That Nebuchadnezzar is the tree. And it’s Nebuchadnezzar who will be banished into the wild. Daniel says, “‘Therefore, your Majesty, be pleased to accept my advice: Renounce your sins by doing what is right, and your wickedness by being kind to the oppressed. It may be that then your prosperity will continue.”</p>
      <p>A year later, God spoke to the king, stripping Nebuchadnezzar of his crown. “He was driven away from people and ate grass like the ox. His body was drenched with the drew of heaven until his hair grew like the feathers of an eagle and his nails like the claws of a bird. At the end of that time, I, Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes toward heaven, and my sanity was restored. Then I praised the Most High; I honored and glorified him who lives forever....At the same time that my sanity was restored, my honor and splendor were returned to me for the glory of my kingdom.”</p>
      <p>Overall, one macro takeaway from the story of Nebuchadnezzar is this: you may not think God had anything to do with your success until one day you realize God had everything to do with your success. After the first dream, Nebuchadnezzar respects God’s wisdom. After the furnace, Nebuchadnezzar respects God’s loyalty. And then after his period of madness and loss of title and humanity, he respects God’s power. It’s only then that we see Nebuchadnezzar become a true believer.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Why</b>
      </p>
      <p>On October 24th, 2019, the day before the release of his album <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrislambert/2019/10/31/jesus-is-king-explained-a-guide-to-the-story-and-themes-of-kanye-wests-2019-album/#5bc11eca7961"><i>Jesus Is King</i></a>, Kanye sat down for a nearly 2-hour interview with Zane Lowe.</p>
      <p>37-minutes into the interview, West says, “Nebuchadnezzar was the king...And he looked at his entire kingdom and said, ‘I did this.’ And God said, ‘Oh, for real? You did this?’ Sounds kind of similar, right? I’m standing on the tip of the mountain talking about Yeezus. Saying, ‘I did this!’ That I’m a God! And I would—I could talk to Jesus at the end of my show. I had (laughs) a guy dressed up as Jesus, at the end of my show.</p>
      <p>West concludes this discussion of the Babylon king with: “Nebuchadnezzar was diagnosed with bipolar disorder...and he was still king!”</p>
      <p>This would resonate with West. He was, at the end of 2016, diagnosed bipolar. And the writing had seemed to be on the wall. West had several moments during his Saint Pablo tour that many, in retrospect, saw as foreshadowing. As <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7595793/kanye-west-hospitalization-experts-health"><i>Billboard</i></a><i> </i>reported on 11/29/16, after West had been sent to the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, “The hospitalization came after a bizarre series of incidents involving the hip-hop superstar, including rants endorsing President-elect Donald Trump, calling out Beyoncé and Jay Z, cutting a concert short, cancelling the remainder of his Saint Pablo Tour, and posting 99 fashion catalog images on his previously spare Instagram feed in the hours before he was transported to the hospital.”</p>
      <p>Kanye would be quiet as a mouse throughout 2017, out of the limelight, focused on family and his health. It wouldn’t be until April of 2018 that he’d return to social media and “Yeezy season” would erupt. Later in the year, after releasing his album <i>ye</i>, that had on the cover, “I hate being bipolar it’s awesome,” West would tell late night host Jimmy Kimmell, “There’s some cases of bipolar where people go low. I’m one that goes high....I don’t know anyone, you know, that fucked up as much as I have that’s still as successful. I want to prove you can get fat, you can say the wrong things, you can piss a whole city off...”</p>
      <p>The 2018 interview seems like the larval stage of the Nebuchadnezzar connection. Kanye understood he had achieved much, been brought low, then, against the odds, recovered. But maybe West didn’t know who or what to attribute that resurrection to. Then he encounters the tale of Nebuchadnezzar. And the light goes on.</p>
      <p>Maybe this opera is his way of spreading the message, of letting people know you can falter, you can fall over, and it’s okay to get back up and continue moving forward. That you can have the audacity to recover.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>*“Infinities Song” is the name on the invite, but it may be a typo. Kanye has been connected to a family band called <a href="https://www.hiphollywood.com/2019/09/5-things-to-know-about-kanyes-new-favorite-group-infinitys-song/">Infinity’s Song</a>.</p>
      <p>**The gold image Nebuchadnezzar wants everyone to praise probably explains the gold image Kanye and designer Nick Knight used for the opera’s invitation.</p>
