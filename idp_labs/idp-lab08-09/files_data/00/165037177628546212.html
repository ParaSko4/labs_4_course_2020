        <b>The drama between Real Madrid and Ajax over the signing of Donny van de Beek started way back. However, 'TMW' now add another name and state that the whites are insistent on looking at the Amsterdam club. Their latest aim is goalkeeper, Andre Onana.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In the summer market, <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/real-madrid">Real Madrid</a> tried to sign<b> Donny van de Beek</b> at the last minute. However, after excelling in the Champions League final with Ajax, together with other plays such as De Jong and De Ligt, the 22-year-old footballer stayed with his team.</p>
      <p><b>Florentino Perez</b> has not twisted his arm and now the rumour is about whether or not Van de Beek <b>will leave in the winter</b>. However, the latest information states that Real Madrid not only want the Ajax midfielder.</p>
      <p>According to 'TMW', the Madrid team have also got their eye on the<b> 23-year-old Cameroon goalkeeper</b> <b>Andre Onana, </b>as a current substitute and future candidate to defend the goal at Real Madrid.</p>

      <p>After Keylor Navas' exit, <b>Thibaut Courtois and Alphonse Areola</b> are the current Madrid goalkeepers, also Courtois is currently also playing for his national team, where he has played <b>14 games to the Frenchman's 3.</b></p>
      <p>Onana's interest speaks for the desire to <b>strengthen the Madrid goalkeeping position</b> after doubts arose about Courtois this season and as anticipation of the possible <b>exits</b> that could be given to Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>So, it's not just Donny van de Beek. Real Madrid also wants to strengthen their goal and, as 'TMW' indicates, André Onana, also from Ajax,<b> is on the list.</b></p>
