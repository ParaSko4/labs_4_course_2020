      <p>On what should have been a normal Sunday, Pamela was doing her washing and tried lifting a basket of dirty clothes. All of a sudden, she found herself in a life-threatening situation after suffering a stroke. Typically, ambulance times in rural areas like the East of England can range between 45 to 60 minutes. However, for a suspected stroke patient, getting them from their home to a hospital as quickly as possible is crucial.</p>
      <p>In Pam’s case, she was admitted to A&amp;E out of hours, which meant there were fewer specialists available. But thanks to software from healthtech firm Visionable, she was put in front of a remote stroke specialist, diagnosed and received treatment immediately.  </p>
      <p>The technology has since been implemented into a connected ambulance solution developed in partnership with telecoms giant O2, which aims to accelerate treatment times for patients like Pam. </p>
      <p>“The team placed a screen in front of me very quickly, where I could see that stoke specialist who was based in Cambridge. He was there, asking me some specific questions that helped him quickly ascertain exactly what treatment I needed. With this early intervention, I only needed a couple of days in the hospital before I was able to get back to my normal life,” remarks Pamela. </p>
      <p>“Putting this type of treatment into an ambulance means that more people will be able to be treated even faster than I was. This really is amazing – I know first-hand the difference that time can make in these types of emergency situations.” </p>
      <p>Unlike standard ambulances, the connected ambulance uses state-of-the-art devices and connectivity to function as a remote consultation room. With this technology, paramedics can access and follow expert consultations to diagnose and treat patients quickly but also communicate with consultants remotely.</p>
      <p>Alan Lowe, CEO of Visionable, says: “We want to bring the right expertise to the scene of emergencies – and the best way to do this is through video technology. By bringing experts to the patients we can help reduce journey times and treatment times.</p>
      <p>“This, in turn, will reduce and ease the strain of clinicians back in A&amp;E, and help reallocate hospital resources elsewhere. Principally, it’s giving the paramedic a ‘consultant in their pockets.” </p>
      <p>The connected ambulance is powered by Visionable’s video collaboration platform, which facilitates communication between the paramedic and the remote expert consultant. Lowe continues: “For example, when someone has a stroke, every minute is crucial. Often the process can be for the patient to be admitted to A&amp;E via an ambulance, and if they are suspected of having a stroke, they are then transferred on to a stroke specialist unit by another ambulance to receive care there.</p>
      <p>“Understandably this eats into essential time for treatment to take place. With our technology life-saving treatment is brought to thousands of people as an expert can be bought into diagnosis remotely and this eliminates the steps of having to be transferred place to place saving critical time.”</p>
      <p>He claims that the system also speeds up crucial treatment for stroke victims. “Thrombolysis treatment is vital, but for the best chance of recovery this needs to be administered within 3 hours,” says Lowe. “While some people may be lucky enough to live close to a stroke specialist unit in close proximity, many will not be so fortunate. This is where connected ambulances can hugely improve access to critical care.”</p>
      <p>Over the past few years, Visionable has been working with the NHS East of England Stroke Telemedicine Partnership to improve the delivery of stroke diagnosis and treatment. Lowe explains:  “Using Visionable’s advanced video collaboration and imaging technology, the NHS East of England Stroke Telemedicine Partnership team has helped a number of patients be assessed, with an average of 41% receiving thrombolysis. This means that health practitioners have been able to work more efficiently, and patients receive faster and better treatment. Treatment time has also been reduced by 48 mins.”</p>
      <p>The firm has since trialed the connected ambulance at the Millbrook Proving Ground, a vehicle testing center in Bedford. “Here, it was safely tested before a similar trial involving six ambulances takes place with the East of England Ambulance Trust. Once we’ve analyzed those results then we will look to see how this can be deployed more extensively,” says Lowe. </p>
      <p>Looking ahead, the firm hopes to bring the technology to hospitals and health centers right around Britain. Lowe concludes: “Our aim is for this to be rolled out to multiple trusts across the country. This project has the potential to transform patient diagnosis, transport and treatment for the healthcare sector.”</p>
