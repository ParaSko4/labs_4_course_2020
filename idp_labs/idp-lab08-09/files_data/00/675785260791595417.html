      <h1>Prince Andrew 'regrets not showing victims sympathy' in disastrous Epstein interview</h1>
      <h2>The Duke of York, is said to have "great sympathy" for the victims of his friend the paedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein - but other reports claim he thought the heavily criticised BBC interview was 'a great success'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:26:40+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 00:26</time> by <a rel="author">Milo Boyd, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/milo-boyd/</a></address>
      <p>Prince Andrew 'regrets not expressing sympathy' for the victims of Jeffrey Epstein during his car crash interview on Saturday night, it is now being claimed.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York said he has "great sympathy" for the victims of the billionaire paedophile, a source told <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7695817/Prince-Andrews-regret-TV-interview.html">The Daily Mail.</a></p>
      <p>The Prince suggested it hadn't seemed necessary to vocalise his sympathy for those abused by Epstein, according to the report.</p>
      <p>"I regret that I didn’t make it clear in the interview that I have great sympathy for anyone who was abused by Jeffrey Epstein," he reportedly told friends yesterday.</p>
      <p>"When I said I was shocked I thought that was implicit. In 2010 none of us had any idea of the extent of his wrongdoing."</p>
      <p>However that appears to contradict another report in the Sun which claims a 'close friend' said the Duke told the Queen at church on Sunday 'it's all been a great success'.</p>
      <p>Epstein was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges when he died in prison earlier this year, having previously pleaded guilty to paying to have sex with a girl below the age of 18.</p>

      <p>The Duke is said to "deeply" regret his friendship with the financier, a source told the Mail, though he said the opposite in the 45 minute interview and actually praised the 'opportunities' the relationship gave him.</p>
      <p>"As a father, he totally condemns any exploitation of vulnerable young women," the source is quoted as saying.</p>
      <p>The Prince has received the anonymous support from his friends the day after the interview aired.</p>
      <p>For some, he appeared less than conciliatory during the BBC Newsnight special.</p>

      <p>At one point he described his relationship with Epstein as “seriously beneficial” because it gave him the opportunity to meet people and help prepare for a future role as a trade envoy.</p>
      <p>The comment led Green Party co-leader Sian Berry to suggest he was “not a very empathetic interview” and Catherine Mayer, founder of the Women’s Equality Party, to say he was “too stupid to even pretend concern for his victims."</p>
      <p>The Duke of York was said to be in good spirits when he joined his mother The Queen on a trip to church in Windsor this morning.</p>

      <p>“The Duke went to church with the Queen and was heard telling her it’s all been a great success," a friend of Andrew told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10365159/prince-andrew-queen-church-success/">The Sun.</a></p>
      <p>“He thinks he’s done the right thing and has put the criticism to rest. He was all smiles and was looking very buoyant and happy.”</p>
      <p>Mother and son were also spotted praying together.</p>
      <p>In last night's wide-ranging interview on BBC Two, the prince claimed he had never had sex with Virginia Giuffre, and did not recall ever meeting her.</p>

      <p>He questioned the validity of a photograph showing the pair pictured together with his arm looped around the then-teenager.</p>
      <p>The Duke also claimed he had been eating at Pizza Express in Woking with daughter Princess Beatrice on one night that Ms Giuffre claims she had sex with the prince when she was 17.</p>
      <p>He said he recalled the pizza dinner "weirdly distinctly" as it was such a rare occurrence.</p>
