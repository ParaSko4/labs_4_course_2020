      <p>Moycullen stunned Griffith College Templeogue on Saturday evening, running out five point winners over the Dubliners in Galway.</p>
      <p>Moycullen book ended the win in perfect fashion, delivering two big quarters in the first and the fourth period to push on to win the game. Grant Olsson led the charge for the hosts early on as they opened up a 26-20 first quarter lead, but quickly got into foul trouble and Templeogue charged back with a strong second quarter to lead by five at the half, 40-45. The Dubliners still had the edge going into the last, 54-58, but Moycullen were in sharpshooting form in the last, with Olsson, Kyle Cunningham and underage international stars James Connaire and Paul Kelly running home some big scores to edge the victory, 75-70 and leave Templeogue still without a road win so far this season.</p>
      <p>Speaking afterwards, Moycullen boss John Cunningham stated: “I’m delighted to get the win. This league is about taking your opportunity on the night and that’s it - we didn’t last week but we did tonight. The most pleasing was that we closed out the game well. Starting the fourth quarter down by four meant that we had work to do, but we played really well at both ends. Grant Olsson was in foul trouble in the first half but he led us very well in the fourth and I have to hand it to Kyle Cunningham who put in a great fourth quarter and hit a big three to give us some leeway. James Connaire made his first start for us tonight and really hit the ground running and it’s great that we can be comfortable at times to go with the guys who step up during the week in training. We’re learning game by game and that’s all I can ask.”</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Keane’s SuperValu Killorglin were on form at home once more running out 88-79 point winners over Pyrobel Killester. Big displays from Rami Ghanem, Daragh Jones, Colin O’Reilly and Allan Thomas, kept the Kerry side out in front at the half, 40-31. Despite a big third quarter from Killester, with a superb display in particular from Ciaran Roe, Killorglin bounced back well in the fourth to see home the win. A late push from Coughlan C&amp;S Neptune meanwhile saw them overcome DCU Saints on the road, 74-80 on Saturday evening. Both sides were without key players on the night with Saints missing Martins Provizors, while Neptune travelled without player/coach Lehmon Colbert and Spaniard, Nil Sabata. The game was close throughout with Mike Bonaparte causing trouble for the Neptune defense, while Peter Hoffman and Cian Heaphy were on form for the Cork outfit. Saints held a seven-point lead with just over three minutes to go, but big scores down the stretch from Gary Walsh, Heaphy and Kyle Hosford edged Neptune into the lead and they didn’t look back from there.</p>
      <p>DBS Éanna got back to winning ways with aplomb, running out 82-92 point winners over UCD Marian in their derby clash. Éanna were in control from early on, opening up a 36-49 point lead at the half, thanks to sharp shooting from Neil Lynch and Josh Wilson. Despite a big display from UCD’s Mike Garrow, Éanna just had too much and held on to win out by 10. Belfast Star were in flying form on Saturday evening to deny Abbey Seals Dublin Lions their first win of the season, running out 20 point winners in the end, 91-71, while Garvey’s Tralee Warriors were also 20 point winners over Maree in Galway, winning out 67-87.</p>
      <p>DCU Mercy remain unbeaten still at the top of the Women’s Super League as they won out in commanding fashion, 50-81, against Pyrobel Killester in Clontarf. Despite a big first quarter from Mercy, sharpshooting Killester were right back in the mix after the second quarter, with Aisling McCann and Adella Randle El getting some big scores to see them trail 33-40 at the half. A huge third quarter from DCU followed, which saw them keep Killester to just three points for the period, while Meredith Burkhall, led the scoring charge in style, finishing the game out with 28 points. There were good displays from Ashley Russell and Sarah Woods, as well as a big defensive effort from Nicole Clancy.</p>
      <p>Speaking afterwards, head coach Mark Ingle stated: “I thought it was a pretty emphatic win. I was more worried about this game than any game in the last few weeks and rightly so because of their form at home and how they’ve been playing. They’re a really exciting team, they play from the three-point line, but credit to the team, our third quarter defensive display was serious – we held that team to three points in that quarter which gave us a platform to play from.”</p>
      <p>Maxol WIT Wildcats finished strong on Saturday evening in Leixlip to win out 71-80 over Leixlip Amenities Liffey Celtics in their clash. The lead changed hands on numerous occasions throughout the game, with Wildcats just edging it by three at half time, before Celtics retook the lead by one point going into the last quarter thanks to good play from Kylee Smith and Aine O’Connor. A big fourth quarter from the visitors followed though, with Jasmine Walker bagging some big scores, while Maria Palarino and Stephanie O’Shea also worked hard under the boards to see Wildcats home to a 71-80 point win.</p>
      <p>Maree remain in second place in the Women’s Super League meanwhile thanks to a hard-earned victory over Fr Mathews in Galway on Sunday afternoon. The hosts finished out 79-73 to the good after a tough battle, with Claire Rockall, Carly McLendon and Michelle Fahy doing most of the scoring damage for Joe Shields’ charges. It was a busy week for Singleton SuperValu Brunell and Ambassador UCC Glanmire meanwhile, as they both had two games – facing off against each other on Wednesday evening in a clash that Glanmire won 72-90, before Glanmire kept their recent winning ways intact with a hard-fought win over Marble City Hawks in Kilkenny, 60-72. Brunell eased passed IT Carlow Basketball on Sunday in their second game, winning out 81-60.</p>
