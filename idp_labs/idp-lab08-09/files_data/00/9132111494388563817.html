      <p>Ogyeahohoo Yaw Gyebi II, the President of the Western Regional House of Chiefs, says he will restrain himself from responding to the name-calling by the President of the National House of Chiefs, Togbe Afede XIV for exposing the falsehood in his ‘No Vote’ statement.</p>
      <p>Togbe Afede hit back at claims by chiefs that the house’s decision to strongly reject multi-party participation at the local governance level was unilateral.</p>
      <p>Togbe Afede described the chiefs who criticised Thursday’s statement as “dishonest” and people exhibiting “wanton mischief.”</p>
      <p>To Ogyeahohoo Yaw Gyebi II, who doubles as the Head of the Governance and Development Committee of the House, the seeming confusion in the house over the ‘No Vote’ statement is regrettable.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview on Accra-based Kasapa FM, monitored by Adomonline.com, the chief maintained that the National House of Chiefs has not adopted a ‘NO Vote’ campaign at any level of its structure.</p>
      <p>“If there was indeed a consensus of a sort backing a ‘No Vote’ in the imminent referendum on local level elections why did the House wait for a certain political party to come up with a ‘No Vote’ before the House’s statement backing same?” he quizzed.</p>
      <p>He urged his colleagues to remain calm and wait for a scheduled meeting on December, 12 or any emergency meeting that may be called forthwith to iron out the issues.</p>
