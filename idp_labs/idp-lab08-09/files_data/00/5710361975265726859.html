      <h1>Etihad Airways still has long way to go to become profitable: Group CEO</h1>

      <p>DUBAI (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways still has a long way to go to become profitable, Group CEO Tony Douglas said on Monday.</p>
      <p>"We are slightly ahead of where we plan to be. And if we stay focused will see a very strong Etihad," Douglas told reporters.</p>
      <p>Etihad suffered its third consecutive annual loss in 2018 despite cost savings of nearly half a billion dollars as it cut its workforce and fleet.</p>
      <p>Etihad, which has trimmed its ambitions to be a major intercontinental airline, has made losses of $4.75 billion since 2016.</p>
      <p>Douglas said a series of announcements are expected over the next two to three weeks about the new low-cost carrier it is setting up with Air Arabia (DU:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/air-arabia">AIRA</a>).</p>
      <p>"A whole schedule of announcements by the end of first quarter, second quarter," he said.</p>
      <p>He declined to be more specific or say which destinations the low-cost carrier will serve.</p>
      <p>The new carrier, Air Arabia Abu Dhabi, will be the UAEâ€™s fifth airline. Others include Emirates and Dubai discount carrier flydubai.</p>
