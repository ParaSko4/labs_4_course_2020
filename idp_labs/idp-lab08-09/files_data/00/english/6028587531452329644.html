      <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/companies/activision-blizzard/"><b>Activision Blizzard’s</b></a><b> (NASDAQ: ATVI)</b> revenue growth will likely see a decline in the low teens in 2019, as compared to an average growth in the mid-single-digits seen between 2016-2018. This can primarily be attributed to the absence of a World of Warcraft release in 2019, while the previous release in 2018 bolstered the sales growth. The revenues will likely pick again in 2020, with the next release of World of Warcraft. This is a popular franchise, and at its peak, it used to have around 12 million active users. In this note we focus on Activision Blizzard’s revenue sources, its business model, and revenue trajectory.

        <b>2019 Will Likely End With a Revenue Decline In the Low Teens</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Activision Blizzard’s average monthly active users (MAUs) declined from 491 million in 2016 to 357 million in 2018, and they could decline to 344 million by 2021.</li>
        <li>The decline in the past can be attributed to King Digital, which saw over 100 million MAUs lost over the last few years, amid increased competition from other game publishers, such as Zynga.</li>
        <li>However, we don’t expect any significant decline in King’s user base going forward, as the company has been focusing on launching new games, which should aid the overall user base.</li>
        <li>Still, the decline in user base in the near term can largely be attributed to other segments, given there will be no release for World of Warcraft in 2019.</li>
        <li>Looking at average revenue per user, it grew from $13.50 in 2016 to $21.00 in 2018. It will also likely decline to $19.40 in 2019 due to the World of Warcraft impact, before rising to $22 levels by 2021, in our view.</li>
