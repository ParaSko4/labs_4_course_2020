      <h1>Beware: Will Disastrous Mistakes Of The 1960s and 1970s Repeat? —Amity Shlaes</h1>

      <p>Mark Twain famously said: “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it does rhyme.” If disastrous mistakes of the 1960s and early 1970s repeat themselves, all of us, especially investors, should be very concerned.</p>
      <p>As Amity Shlaes says about that period in her new, amazingly prescient and well-written book, <i>Great Society: A New History</i>, “Many Americans ached to remake American society over.” Some great and necessary things were accomplished, especially in civil rights. But overall, good intentions led to so many dreadful results, especially in destroying African-American communities in northern cities. Government involvement in healthcare unintentionally led to spiraling costs. Misbegotten economic policy gave us and the world a terrible period of economic stagnation and inflation. </p>
      <p>But these and other failures and disappointments have been largely forgotten. Once again, many people are advocating a replay—in spirit—of the Great Society.</p>
      <p>Currently, as happened over a half-century ago, proposals for radical changes in American life—among them, government takeover of healthcare, unprecedented government domination of business, free college and wealth taxes—are being floated by an array of politicians, academics, students, union leaders, lawyers, activists, entertainers, some business biggies and others. Then and today, almost all looked to government to right wrongs and to remake America into a more just and inclusive society with greater income equality. </p>
      <p>Back in the 1960s, similarly vaulting aspirations were captured by President Lyndon Johnson’s moniker, The Great Society. Its centerpiece was the “War on Poverty.” After all, we had overcome the Great Depression and won the Second World War. Abolishing poverty, eradicating urban slums, giving cheap or free medical care to the elderly and other desirable goals would be very doable if the will was there. The success in putting a man on the moon reinforced this attitude of “we can achieve anything if we put our minds to it.”</p>

      <p>This is what makes my conversation with Amity Shlaes so interesting and timely: a critical and well-told story from which we can learn so much—if only we listen and take heed. </p>
