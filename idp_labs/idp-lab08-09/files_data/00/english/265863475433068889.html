The origins of the rumors seemed to have begun when Emily posted some pictures on Instagram then deleted them. Though it’s impossible to tell what is really going on in a person’s life based on the pictures they post on social media, many fans were concerned that Emily deleted the pictures because there was trouble between herself and Sebastian.</p>

      <p>So far, it seems there aren’t any obvious problems in Sebastian’s and Emily’s marriage and the couple seems very much in love when they are seen together out in public.</p>
