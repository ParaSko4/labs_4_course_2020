      <p>CAIRO – 18 November 2019: President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has made his fourth visit to Germany, this time to take part in the G20 Compact with Africa initiative that is led by Berlin, with the aim of supporting economic cooperation between Africa and G20 countries through joint projects. <br/><br/>According to the CwA, the initiative will witness the participation of "reform-minded African countries, international organizations and bilateral partners from G20 and beyond." <br/><br/>The initiative seeks to "coordinate country-specific reform agendas, support respective policy measures and advertise investment opportunities to private investors," the CwA said on its website. <br/><br/>Following June 30 revolution against the Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated former President Mohamed Morsi, Egyptian relations with Germany, along with many other countries, had been strained. However, diplomatic, and subsequently economic relations with Germany have been restored in a short time. <br/><br/><b>Biarritz G7 summit</b> <br/><br/>Sisi also met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in August this year on the sidelines of the G7 summit held in Biarritz, France.</p>
