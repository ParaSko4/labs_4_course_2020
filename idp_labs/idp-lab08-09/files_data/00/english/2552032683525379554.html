      <p>South Korea’s trade deficit with Japan is expected to sink to a 16-year low in 2019 due to a tumble in imports, data showed Monday.</p>
      <p>Seoul posted a trade deficit of US$16.37 billion with Tokyo in the first 10 months of this year, down 20.6 percent from a year earlier, according to the data from the industry and trade ministry and the Korea International Trade Association.</p>
      <p>It marks the lowest trade deficit with the neighboring country for the January-October period since the red ink of $15.57 billion in 2003.</p>
      <p>Given the current trend, South Korea’s trade deficit with the neighboring country is tipped to hover below the $20 billion mark for the whole of this year and reach its lowest level since the $19.04 billion posted in 2003.</p>
      <p>The sharp drop in this year’s trade deficit with Japan came as imports fell much faster than exports.</p>
      <p>South Korean imports plunged 12.8 percent on-year during the 10-month period, while exports shrank 6.5 percent.</p>
      <p>The faster drop in imports resulted mainly from weaker demand from Samsung Electronics Co. and SK hynix Inc. for chip parts and equipment amid a global slump in the memory-chip business.</p>
      <p>Chip behemoths Samsung Electronics and SK hynix sharply slashed their capital spending this year amid falling memory chip prices and slackening demand.</p>
      <p>Another factor was a local boycott of Japanese consumer goods stemming from Japan’s restrictions on exports of key industrial materials to South Korea, sources said.</p>
      <p>In particular, sales of Japanese vehicles in South Korea more than halved in the four months since July, when Tokyo imposed the export controls.</p>
      <p>Experts have predicted South Korea’s trade deficit with Japan may swing to an upturn next year should the global chip industry recover from the current slump.</p>
      <p>Yet South Korea’s trade balance with Tokyo will likely show a different pattern in the mid to long term, given Seoul’s efforts to nurture its parts and materials industry in the wake of the Japanese move.</p>
