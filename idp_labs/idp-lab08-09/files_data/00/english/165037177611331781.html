      <h1>Kroos: March will be key for Euros</h1>

        <b>Toni Kroos, who does not think Germany should celebrate simply qualifying for Euro 2020, thinks March matches will show how good they are.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/t-kroos-2100/">Toni Kroos</a> believes <b>Germany will have a better idea </b>if they can compete for Euro 2020 glory<b> after next March's international matches.</b></p>
      <p>Joachim Low's side secured their place at next year's finals <b>with a 4-0 win over Belarus on Saturday</b>, in which Real Madrid star Kroos scored twice. The midfielder said after the game that Germany could not consider themselves among the favourites <b>to take Portugal's continental crown next year</b>, given the lack of experience of some of their players.</p>
      <p>However, <b>speaking ahead of Tuesday's final qualifier</b> against Northern Ireland, in which<b> a win will ensure Germany finish top of Group C,</b> Kroos claimed they will have a clearer idea of their ability to challenge after the first international break of next year.</p>
      <p>"It's no surprise that we want to win the game. Of course, <b>the chance to finish first in the group</b> is a bit of extra motivation," he told reporters on Monday. "We've got some good players who have had some minutes. In terms of a grade, I'd put the year between a B and a C,<b> because it's nothing special that we've qualified</b>.</p>

      <p>"<b>Several of the younger players have improved already</b>. We've made some progress. The international games in March will be important again as we play against big nations. <b>We'll have to wait and see how we perform at the Euros</b>, but I have a good feeling about it."</p>

      <p>Kroos partnered<b> Joshua Kimmich at the heart of Germany's midfield</b> in the win over Belarus and believes the Bayern Munich star <b>can make a success of such a role </b>for the national team in future.</p>
      <p><b>"Jo can do both</b>: he can make life difficult for our opponents and he's able to make smart decisions with the ball. <b>The fact that we work well together</b> wasn't a surprise to me," he said.</p>
