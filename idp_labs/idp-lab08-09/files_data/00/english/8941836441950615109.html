      <p>MEXICO CITY (AP) - Left tackle Russell Okung is out for a second straight week when the Los Angeles Chargers face the Kansas City Chiefs at Azteca Stadium on Monday night.</p>
      <p>Okung has a groin injury that kept him out against Oakland 11 days ago, and he hadn’t improved enough to face the Chiefs (6-4) in a vital game for the Chargers’ (4-6) playoff hopes.</p>
      <p>Running back Damien Williams and cornerback Kendall Fuller were notable inactives for the Chiefs. Williams missed practices last week for personal reasons but was expected to travel to Mexico City.</p>
      <p>Williams has 302 yards rushing and three touchdowns this season. He has more carries than LeSean McCoy, who was active in Mexico after being a healthy scratch last week.</p>
      <p>Also inactive for the Chiefs, DE Alex Okafor, TE Blake Bell, OL Nick Allegretti, OL Jackson Barton, RB Darwin Thompson, QB Chad Henne.</p>
