        <b>The Estadio Nacional de 12 Julho has come under scrutiny ahead of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier between São Tomé and Ghana on Monday. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Ghana's squad arrived in the island country to meet a bad pitch which only will not affect the quality of play but also the health of the players.</p>
      <p>They spent about 40 minutes on the pitch in an attempt to acclimatize.</p>
      <p>Prior to their departure from Accra, the Black Stars trained on a fake grass in Madina- a newly constructed playing turf.</p>
      <p>Ghana are seeking to make it two straight wins after an opening 2-0 win over South Africa in Cape Coast last Thursday.</p>
      <p>A draw with Sao Tome and Principe will take the Black Stars to the summit of the Group C table after South Africa beat Sudan at home on Sunday.</p>
