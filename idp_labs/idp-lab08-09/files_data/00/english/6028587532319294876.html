      <p>"Don't ask kids what they want to be when they group up. Ask them what problems they want to solve." It is hard to attend any conference about education or the future of work without seeing this powerful quote from <a href="https://twitter.com/jcasap">Jaime Casap</a>, Google’s Chief Education Evangelist. Casap’s work leading Google’s pioneering educational technology initiatives, his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/jaimecasap">thought-provoking Youtube channel</a>, and his keynote addresses at hundreds of international conferences make it clear what problem he is trying to solve: giving young, poor children of color a better shot a success in our rapidly changing workforce. His influence is not just global. As one of the founding minds behind the <a href="https://www.phoenixunion.org/coding">Phoenix Coding Academy</a>, an innovative high school for students in the heart of Phoenix, Arizona, Casap’s impact is literally felt in his own backyard.To explain what drives his work, Casap sat down for an interview in Phoenix to discuss his role at Google, his new Ghetto People Productions venture, and how his struggles growing up in the Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood of New York City created his “why” for this work.</p>
      <p><b>Colin Seale</b>: I want to start with understanding what a Chief Educational Evangelist is and how you came to be in this position.</p>
      <p><b>Jamie Casap</b>: I joined Google’s engineering team in Phoenix and the CIO said, “Look, we’re on the <a href="https://www.asu.edu/">Arizona State University </a>(ASU) campus. We’re going to get around a thousand requests of projects that ASU wants Google to work on and your job is to filter those and come up with one or two that make sense for us.” So, when I met with the CIO and asked him what his biggest problem was his answer was “email.”</p>
      <p>Two weeks later, we launched <a href="https://edu.google.com/?modal_active=none">Google Apps for Education</a> (GAFE) that ASU was the first university to use. I remember thinking "this could have a huge impact on education." So, I jumped in and started working with universities and then realized this could also be beneficial for K-12 education. Then, I signed Oregon, who launched GAFE for all the school districts in Oregon. I changed my philosophy to not focus on "this how you can use technology" to talk about "what we need to do in education and how technology can help us do that." And as I was doing those types of presentations, I had a education technology leader in Michigan tell me that my title was not really an education manager, but an evangelist. So that's where my title came from and I've been using that ever since.</p>
      <p><b>Seale</b>: That explains what you’re doing. But having seen you speak so passionately about education, I want to why you got into this line of work.</p>
      <p><b>Casap</b>: I would look around at these meetings and realize “there aren’t a lot of advocates at my level for black and brown poor kids. Not just black and brown, but also poor, cause that’s a huge difference. And thought, “<i>That’s</i> the problem I want to solve.” Because either I have a 500 IQ, and that’s why I’ve been able to do what I’m doing. Or, there are millions of kids who are just like me who just didn’t have the luck, opportunities, methodology or the track to get to where I am. A lot of what happened to me was luck. What I want to try to do is eliminate luck as a requirement for success. Even though it’s a big part of everyone’s success.</p>
      <p>But it feels like when it comes to poor, black, and brown people, the majority of it is luck. You have to be seen by the right person at the right time, or you have to write the right article at the right time, you know, someone has to come "save” you. For me, luck was being able to get a scholarship to go to graduate school, luck was getting my first job at Accenture, luck was someone recognizing my talents at Charles Schwab to get me an interview at Google. So that's the problem I'm trying to solve: creating the mechanism and the structures so that black and brown and poor people have the same opportunity I had.</p>
      <p><b>Seale</b>: When I've seen you present, I've heard you bring up growing up in New York City in Hell's Kitchen and you talk about what it was like before gentrification. I don't recall you talking a lot about what that specifically meant for you personally.</p>
      <p><b>Casap</b>: It was a tough place. My mother came from Argentina, I grew up without a father. My mother tried to find jobs; she was a domestic worker. She cleaned whatever she could clean to make money. We talk about growing up in stressful environments and all that—that was me. I remember being a teenager and actually <i>making it home</i> was an accomplishment. It was the early 80’s, we had the crack epidemic. Things were bad in the 60’s and 70’s but the crack epidemic just made it worse. We were sitting on a stoop one night and a random kid we knew from the neighborhood came up and put a knife in my cousin’s neck and said “I just need money.” It was insane. You just couldn’t tell where the danger was coming from. There were blocks that you just wouldn’t go to. There were prostitutes shot from the windows—it was just a mess.</p>
      <p><b>Seale</b>: Right now, a big conversation in education is around trauma-informed pedagogy. People are becoming more aware of what it means to grow up in conditions like yours. As part of this, what I start to see happening is a lot of drama around this trauma. How can we start to shift this narrative to say a lot of what our kids are going to accomplish is not despite these experiences, but <i>because </i>of them?</p>
      <p><b>Casap</b>: That’s a great way to look at it and that’s exactly how I look at it. And this is what I talk to students about. I would say if you’re growing up the way I grew up, not only should you not be ashamed, but you should own it. You should be proud of it and you should tell people about it. Where you come from, and your experiences, are your competitive advantage because you’re going to have a different perspective. You’re going to have a different point of view. The way you see the world is going to be completely different than everybody else in the room. You have to own that and say “this is who I am, this is where I came from, and this is my perspective.” Own who you are and where you come from. .</p>
      <p><b>Seale</b>: I agree that it could be empowering, even healing, to start owning the story. But when you share these stories in front of audiences that don’t come from these experiences, they might end up saying, “wow, everyone can just be like Jamie Casap if they work hard enough.” How do you avoid people coming up with the wrong conclusions from sharing your stories?</p>
      <p><b>Casap</b>: It’s these low expectations that people have growing up. “If Jamie can do it, I can do it” is the message I want for kids. But when the outside world is like “oh all you’ve got to do is act like Jamie did and work harder and you’ll be fine,” I realize that we need to change the systems. I want kids, students, people who grew up the way I did, to say, not necessarily that if they do exactly what I did then they’re going to be successful, but that they believe in themselves. It’s this idea of low expectations syndrome. You are born with low expectation syndrome and you have for the rest of your life unless you purposefully change that expectation.</p>
      <p><b>Seale</b>: Ghetto People Productions: Can you talk a little bit about why you started this and what you hope to accomplish with this new venture?</p>
      <p><b>Casap</b>: So, the idea behind Ghetto People Productions is cemented in the same idea that you brought up, which is proud of who you are and where you come from. I love the reaction when people say "ugh, don't call it that. "Ghetto" is just a bad word." No, it's not, you made it bad. Just because you feel guilty that it's a ghetto, doesn't mean that I'm not good with it being a ghetto. The fact I grew up there gives me a different perspective and a different point of view. I'll say this about the billionaire friends that I have—they want to help a lot of the time. But where they sit, though, can't get them in front of those people. There's a kid in South Chicago that has this great idea for a clothing line. If you’re sitting in a yoga studio in Palo Alto, how are you ever gonna meet that kid? So, what I’m trying to do is create that network to find great ideas and solutions and connect them with funding. And the billionaire doesn’t want to invest in it because it’s the “right thing to do”, they want to invest because they recognize that it’s an untapped, highly profitable market.</p>
      <p><b>Seale</b>: You have been recording this interview in this studio yourself with your own film equipment. You do the same for your YouTube channel. You can afford to have someone do this for you. Why are doing this yourself?</p>
      <p><b>Casap</b>: Two things are going on. Number one is I'm a control freak. I'm such a control freak that my car is a manual. I want to learn how to do this so I can talk about it. I want to be able to talk about these things. As a leader, you need to be able to speak the language. Mastery isn’t just getting better at what you do. When someone says I have “20 years experience” do you have one year of experience for 20 years or do you actually have 20 years of experience?</p>
      <p><b>Seale</b>: So how can we become lifelong learners who keep on sharpening that saw?</p>
      <p><b>Casap</b>: It’s being comfortable with being uncomfortable. Being comfortable with not knowing. I can't tell you how many times I've been in a room when somebody keeps speaking of something, CBW, for instance, over and over again. Well, what the hell is CBW? So, I ask and everyone else is like “yeah, what is a CBW? I want to know too!” People are afraid to look like they don’t know, and I don’t care if I don’t know. To be honest, I think part of that was being able to be at Google for 15 years because I get away with people thinking that I’m smart. So when I ask stupid questions people are like “wow, what a brilliant question!” But it’s been true the whole time. People say that taking classes is what makes you smarter. That’s not what makes you smarter. What makes you smarter is not knowing something, it’s learning it, and then experiencing it. You’ve got to fail over and over and over again.</p>
      <p><b>Seale</b>: As a policy nut, if you had 30 minutes to speak with everyone who could potentially be president in this 2020 election, what would be the <i>one thing</i> that you would want to see changed in our K-12 education policy?</p>
      <p><b>Casap</b>: First, we need to pay teachers more. We don’t pay teachers nearly enough. I’m talking about a living wage where you can survive. They have student loans, they have a mortgage, they have a car payment. There's a point where you aren't worried about surviving and figuring out which bill you're gonna pay. Let’s start there. Creating a living wage for educators for where they live. Then the second thing I would want to bring up is giving more control back to the local communities, especially around assessments.</p>
      <p><b>Seale</b>: The states have become kind of power almighty when it comes to assessments in particular.</p>
      <p><b>Casap</b>: Right, and the federal government is part of that too. Now I’m not saying that test scores are bad, but is that really how we’re going to define success? I just saw an article that says <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-can-pass-standardized-testsbut-it-would-fail-preschool/">artificial intelligence performs better on standardized tests than humans</a>, but they perform miserably at preschool level stuff because it’s different skill sets. My question is, why are training kids to take tests that machines can do already? To me, it's about assessments. Back to policy, what gets measured gets done. So, if we’re measuring problem-solving skills, collaboration skills, communication, creativity. If could figure out how to measure those things then, potentially, we can focus on those things.  </p>
      <p><b>Seale</b>: So, if you localize policy, what might be different? Just taking your experience with the <a href="https://www.phoenixunion.org/">Phoenix Union High School District</a>, being such an integral part of the <a href="https://www.phoenixunion.org/coding">Phoenix Coding Academy</a>. How would you measure success at that school if you had the freedom to do that?</p>
      <p><b>Casap</b>: I think taking quizzes are important. But I think you can “test“ in the real world. With photography, for example, I don't need to be tested. My product is the test. And I think we can do this more in education. </p>
      <p>Often the response is "well it's hard to measure those things.” Well just because it’s hard doesn’t mean we shouldn’t do it. You asked me about the Coding Academy—when I talk about the measures of a successful school, I want to look at measures like this: are they happy there? and do the kids show up early for school? And then the postgraduate stuff: Do you graduate? Do you go to college and or get a job? Are you happy? Are you a contributing member of society?</p>
      <p><b>Seale</b>: Finally, I write about preparing diverse learners for the future of work. What do you think readers need to know about this?</p>
      <p><b>Casap</b>: I always get asked how do I get a job at Google? My response is “don’t.” Don't work at Google. Make your own damn Google. I think we are shooting way to low. This idea that we are preparing kids for the workforce is insane. We have to change because that is where the trend is going. 70% of the up and coming generation doesn't want to work for you at all. They see that 70% of Americans are disengaged from what they do. That generation is like yeah, we're not coming, we're not gonna work for you. Today, any kid with a laptop can start any business they want. Skills like critical thinking and entrepreneurship are much more important to teach students. Don't come work for Google, create a product or service and then be bought by Google. </p>
