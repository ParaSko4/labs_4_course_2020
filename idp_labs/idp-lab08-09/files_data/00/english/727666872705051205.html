      <p>The cops say a man in Henderson, Nevada hatched a scheme to rob rapper Succeed Phlyguy using pizza delivery scheme.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News)</b> Police in Henderson, Nevada have finally apprehended a man involved in the senseless killing of rapper Succeed Phlyguy.</p>
      <p>Succeed Phlyguy, real name, Ronnie Cravens Jr., was shot and killed during a home invasion on October 12th.</p>
      <p>According to the cops, a man named Angell Cordero Fernandez surprised the rapper by obtaining access through his home's garage and simply ringing the doorbell.</p>

        <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/former-jet-life-rapper-succeed-phlyguy-murdered-in-home-invasion-MZzfXe6VH0W-bbQ4GspBGw/">Once someone answered the door, Fernandez barged inside and attempted to rob Succeed Phlyguy and his roommates.</a>
      </p>
      <p>A shootout followed, and Succeed Phlyguy was hit and killed in the crossfire.</p>
      <p>But investigators say the home invasion was well-planned out over the course of several days.</p>
      <p>Fernandez used a dummy number to text message the rapper with offers of free pizzas two different times in the days leading up to the murder.</p>
      <p>Surveillance footage captured the home invasion and Fernandez made the blunder of momentarily exposing his face during the robbery.</p>
      <p>Fernandez managed to scurry away with Succeed Phlyguy's diamond chain and his Rolex watch.</p>
      <p>According to News3 Las Vegas, the getaway car Fernandez drove to commit the home invasion/murder was easily traceable, because it was registered to his wife.</p>
