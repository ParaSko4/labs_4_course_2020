      <p>VANDALIA, Ill. (AP) - A small Illinois school is grieving the deaths of two students in a weekend crash that also killed the grandparents of one of the girls.</p>
      <p>Fourteen-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/vandalia-high-school/">Vandalia High School</a> freshman Jenna Protz died along with her grandparents, 73-year-old William Protz and 72-year-old Jackolyn Protz. She was the daughter of Principal Randy Protz. The couple were his parents.</p>
      <p>The other teen who died, 14-year-old Holly Lidy, was the daughter of school speech therapist Anita Lidy. The four were returning home from a Vandalia football playoff game in Williamsville.</p>
      <p>“They will be remembered for their smiles, their kindness, for their selflessness. Model students, leaders in our freshmen class,” Vandalia Superintendent Jennifer Garrison said of the girls.</p>
      <p>Police said a 17-year-old drove his pickup truck over the center line and struck a van carrying the four Saturday night in Montgomery County, southeast of Springfield. The teen was in a hospital with serious injuries, they said. The crash remained under investigation Monday.</p>

        <p>“We’ll never forget them,” classmate Carley Miller said of the girls. “Even if they were down themselves, they would never show it. They would always be there for everybody else.”</p>
