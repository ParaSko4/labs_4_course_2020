      <p>LG is bringing in the holiday season with its cashback offer on its ‘great refrigeration solution for Australian families’.</p>
      <p>Select French Door models feature the InstaView panel allowing for the use of gestures to see what’s in the fridge without having even to open the door.</p>
      <p>LG’s door-in-door feature reduces the loss of cold air and temperature fluctuations while also cleverly utilising the space within the fridge itself.</p>
      <p>The lineup of Slim French Door Fridges is specifically designed to fit a narrower fridge alcove with a width of 850mm, making them suitable for apartment owners, renters and tiny house owners alike.</p>
      <p>Brad Reed, Senior Marketing Manager for Home Appliances at LG Electronics Australia, believes there is no better time to upgrade your fridge than the holiday period, thanks, especially to the cashback promotion.</p>
      <p>‘Upgrade your fridge to a model that can cope with the increased demands.’</p>
