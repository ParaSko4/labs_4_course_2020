      <h1>GMA Dramas draw strong viewership in Kenya, Dominican Republic</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">GMA New Media, Inc.</a></address>
      <p>GMA dramas continue to be popular among viewers in Kenya and Dominican Republic through the solid partnerships built by the Network’s content distribution subsidiary, GMA Worldwide, Inc. (GWI).</p>
      <p>According to data from African surveying platform Geopoll, English-dubbed versions of several GMA programs airing in Kenya via KTN TV are exceeding expected figures for primetime viewership.</p>
      <p>Among the most-watched programs on KTN TV was the 2016 Kapuso romantic drama Once Again. It debuted with a strong 1.4 million viewers and soared to a peak of 2.3 million viewers. Airing primetime on weekdays, the intriguing story of resurrected star-crossed lovers received positive reviews from Kenyan viewers.</p>
      <p>Following Once Again is the internationally acclaimed drama Ang Dalawang Mrs. Real (The Other Mrs. Real) with viewership that peaked at 1.8 million. The drama, which was a Silver Screen Awardee of the US International Film and Video Festival, was praised by Kenyan viewers for its delicate and mature treatment of the controversial theme of infidelity.</p>
      <p>Also with a peak viewership of 1.8 million was Pamilya Roces (Family Jewels). The comedy-drama about feuding sisters drew many viewers, especially fans of actress Carla Abellana who became popular among Kenyans after starring in My Destiny, Together Again, and Losing Heaven.</p>
      <p>KTN TV also aired the dramas Hanggang Makita Kang Muli (Until We Meet Again), an intriguing drama about a feral child; and Someone To Watch Over Me, a story of a wife’s sacrifice for her husband diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s disease. Viewership of these dramas peaked at 1.5 million and 1.4 million, respectively.</p>
      <p>The dramas’ unique storylines which portray the struggles of characters, who eventually triumph, appeal to Kenyan viewers. Made possible by GWI’s collaboration with Standard Media Group, GMA continues to strengthen its presence in the region by providing top-rating content not only to Kenya, but to the rest of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
      <p>Likewise, GMA Network’s ground-breaking drama Onanay (The Way To Your Heart) is making waves in the Dominican Republic as it delivers high ratings for broadcaster Color Vision. The Spanish-dubbed version entitled El Amor Mas Grande scored an average audience share of 12.48% between October 10 to 23 making it the second most-watched program on the 4 to 5 P.M. timeslot and contributing to Color Vision’s strong daytime ratings.</p>
      <p>Dominicano fans of the series also show their support on social media, praising it for its unique and unpredictable plot, and for shedding light on the story of little people.</p>

      <p>El Amor Mas Grande entered the Dominican Republic via GWI’s successful partnership with Latin Media Corp. It tells the story of a mother with achondroplastic dwarfism longing for the acceptance of her daughter, while struggling through her difficult situation complicated by the lies, prejudice and discrimination around her.</p>
