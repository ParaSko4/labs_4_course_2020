      <p>TWIN FALLS, Idaho (AP) - An Idaho college has received a $1.1 million grant to help reverse a statewide teacher shortage through an alternative certification program.</p>
      <p>The Times-News reports the College of Southern Idaho plans to expand its Non-Traditional Educator Preparation Program.</p>
      <p>The state Workforce Development Council operating under the office of Republican Gov. Brad Little approved the grant.</p>
      <p>Officials say the program is for teachers without a certificate or hoping to change their certificate and career changers or paraprofessionals who want to become fully accredited teachers.</p>
      <p>Officials say the accelerated, four-semester program provides classroom mentors for hands-on training as well as monthly course material delivered in person or online.</p>
