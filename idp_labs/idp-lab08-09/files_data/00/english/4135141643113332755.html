      <p>ST. LOUIS — <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/myles-powell-player-stats">Myles Powell</a> scored 26 points and <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/sandro-mamukelashvili-player-stats">Sandro Mamukelashvili</a> added 17 in No. 12 Seton Hall’s 83-66 victory over Saint Louis on Sunday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/quincy-mcknight-player-stats">Quincy McKnight</a> added 12 points to help the <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/seton-hall-pirates-team">Pirates</a> (3-1) rebound from a 76-73 loss to No.3 Michigan State on Thursday night.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/hasahn-french-player-stats">Hasahn French</a> led Saint Louis (3-1) with 14 points and 10 rebounds.</p>
      <p>Mamukelashvili hit a 3-pointer to start the game. <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/romaro-gill-player-stats">Romaro Gill</a> put down a slam off a pass from Powell for a 7-0 lead. <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/myles-cale-player-stats">Myles Cale</a> followed with a 3-pointer.</p>
      <p>After scoring the game’s first 10 points, Seton Hall led 18-3 after 7:09. The Pirates made seven straight shots during the early blitz. Saint Louis got no closer than eight points the rest of the way.</p>
      <p>Seton Hall led 46-31 at the break and scored the first seven points of the second half.</p>
      <p>Powell, who scored 37 points in the loss to Michigan State, added six rebounds.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/saint-louis-billikens-team">Billikens</a> had won the previous three games between the teams.</p>
      <p>SIZE MATTERS</p>
      <p>Seton Hall is one of nine teams in the country with more than one 7-footer. Senior Romaro Gill and sophomore <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/ikey-obiagu-player-stats">Ike Obiagu</a> both stand 7-2. Hawaii is the only team with three 7-footers.</p>
      <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
      <p>Seton Hall: The Pirates showed plenty of offensive balance early when Powell struggled. They also applied defensive pressure early, forcing the Billikens to miss their first five shots.</p>
      <p>Saint Louis: The Billikens stumbled in their first big test of the season. Their last home win against a ranked team was a 76-62 triumph over No. 24 Virginia Commonwealth on Feb. 19, 2013.</p>
