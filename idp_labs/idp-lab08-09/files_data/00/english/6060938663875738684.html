      <p>NEW DELHI: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mutual-fund">Mutual fund</a> investment in stock markets halved to Rs 55,700 crore in the first 10 months of the year because of lower participation from retail investors.</p>
      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Fund-managers">Fund managers</a> had bought shares worth about Rs 1.12 lakh crore during January-October 2018, according to the data provided by Sebi.</p>
      <p>Vidya Bala, co-founder of Primeinvestor.in, said, “Despite markets moving to new highs, since the rally is restricted to select stocks, retail investors have not seen any positive impact on their wealth. Unless retail appetite increases, this trend may continue.”</p>
      <p>Omkeshwar Singh, head of mutual fund distribution business at Samco, said although the overall flow per month in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/equities">equities</a> has been positive, if SIP inflows are removed, then such inflows turned negative, therefore the investment has been lower.</p>
