      <p>CONWAY, Ark. (AP) - A former high school student in Arkansas has been sentenced to seven years in prison for devising a plan to shoot up a school.</p>
      <p>Circuit Judge Charles Clawson sentenced 20-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/daniel-croslin/">Daniel Croslin</a> on Friday. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/daniel-croslin/">Croslin</a> pleaded guilty to making a terrorist threat in September.</p>
      <p>Court documents show <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/daniel-croslin/">Croslin</a> made plans to shoot up Conway High School on the 20th anniversary of the Columbine massacre. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/daniel-croslin/">Croslin</a> was 19 when he told a counselor that he was bullied in school and wanted to get revenge.</p>
      <p>Police found <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/daniel-croslin/">Croslin</a>’s notes that included a diagram of the school and evidence that he recruited friends to help him buy an assault rifle and item needed for a pipe bomb.</p>
