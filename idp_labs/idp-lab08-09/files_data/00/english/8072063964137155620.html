      <p><b>(JAMAICA OBSERVER)</b> —  The original soundtrack to Watchmen, HBO’s recently launched series, features songs by two Jamaican acts — Desmond Dekker and The Aces’ Israelites and Do Your Thing by Leroy Sibbles.</p>
      <p>Israelites was featured in episode three, which aired on November 3. It helped the song enter this week’s Billboard Reggae Digital Song Sales Chart at number two.</p>
      <p>Fifty-one years ago, Israelites peaked at number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart and went to number one in the United Kingdom. Co-written by Dekker and producer Leslie Kong, the song was a massive hit in Jamaica before exploding in Europe and the United States.</p>
      <p>It is the first reggae song to top the British chart. Dekker died in the United Kingdom in 2006.</p>
