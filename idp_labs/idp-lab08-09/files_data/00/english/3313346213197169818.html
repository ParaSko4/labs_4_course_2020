      <p>Nintendo is preparing to introduce a subscription plan into <i>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</i>, doubling down on the model <a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/351131/Nintendos_freetoplay_mobile_Mario_Kart_now_offers_a_monthly_subscription.php">initially used in <i>Mario Kart Tour</i> last month</a>.</p>
      <p>In an email sent out to <i>Pocket Camp</i> players (<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-is-introducing-a-paid-membership-service.153558/#post-26540038">posted on ResetEra</a>), the company said it would be celebrating the game's second anniversary by rolling out a new paid membership service called Pocket Camp Club.</p>
      <p>Due to launch on November 21, Pocket Camp Club will come in the form of two different subscription plans: one that lets players receive fortune cookies and store their clothes and furniture in warehouses, and another that lets them bring in a "camp caretaker" to get some extra help around their campsite.</p>
      <p>It's currently unclear how much each package will cost, although we'll likely find out in a few days time, with Nintendo promising to share more details on November 20.</p>
      <p>This isn't the first time Nintendo has experimented with monetization methods on mobile. The company's first proper smartphone game, <i>Super Mario Run</i>, was a free-to-download premium experience that asked players to pay $9.99 for the full game after completing a set of demo levels.</p>
      <p>Although the game was downloaded over 150 million times, <a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/301130/How_Super_Mario_Runs_lackluster_sales_are_changing_Nintendos_mobile_strategy.php">only 10 percent of those translated into full purchases</a>. After that, the company pivoted towards more traditional free-to-play methods with titles like <i>Fire Emblem Heroes</i>, <i>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</i>, and <i>Dr. Mario World</i>, which feature a variety of in-app purchases.</p>
      <p>More recently, however, Nintendo mixed things up again by adding a Gold Pass subscription service to <i>Mario Kart Tour </i>(which also features traditional in-app purchases). Priced at $4.99 per month, the service grants <i>Mario Kart Tour</i> players access to more in-game rewards like karts and badges, and also unlocks 200cc races.</p>
      <p>You can see the email Nintendo sent out to <i>Pocket Camp </i>players below. Thanks again for the spot, ResetEra.</p>
