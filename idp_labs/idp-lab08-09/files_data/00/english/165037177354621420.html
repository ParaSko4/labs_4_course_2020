        <b>For several days, the Everton player Moise Kean has been linked with a move to Roma. The Italians will apparently look for a loan deal with a purchase clause of 22 million euros.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/roma">Roma</a> <b>are looking for a striker </b>and <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/m-kean-307752/">Moise Kean</a>, as a result of his problems at Everton, is one of the possible candidates<b>. Everton paid close to 30 million euros for Moise Kean</b> from Juve, but he is not performing well in the Premier League. </p>
      <p>Therefore the Italian could return to Serie A and <b>Roma are interested in getting him for the second half</b> of the season. </p>
