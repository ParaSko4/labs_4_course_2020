      <h1>Moree Plains Shire Council explores drought relief initiatives</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:22:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 00:22</time> by <a rel="author">Sophie Harris</a></address>
      <p>Moree Plains Shire Council will be looking into a number of drought relief initiatives to help ease some of the pressures this unprecedented drought is having on the community.</p>
      <p>At council's ordinary meeting on Thursday, November 14, councillors resolved to prepare a draft Drought Policy which outlines how council can respond to drought in the long-term.</p>
      <p>As part of the drought policy, councillors agreed on a list of 15 potential drought relief options that council can either facilitate, advocate and lobby for, or directly implement to help the community now.</p>
      <p>With the drought taking a significant toll on the Moree community, through loss of income for agricultural producers, negative multiplier effects through the business sector, loss of on-farm labour and expertise, and mental health and wellbeing issues, council's director of planning and community development Angus Witherby said council has come up with a number of ways to address some of these issues.</p>

      <p>"One of the things that is emerging is a strong need for injections of cash in local businesses," he said at the meeting.</p>
      <p>"What we've done is to set out a range of suggestions that have come forward from staff, many of whom have family members that work on the land and are very aware of the challenges .</p>
      <p>"We will also consider preparing a more comprehensive drought policy. We've seen the impacts on the community are broad indeed. I do see value in this council establishing a broader policy position now for when we inevitably get another drought in the future.</p>
      <p>"The draft policy will be looking at a broader range of issues where council can either do things directly, for instance refine how drought fits in with our existing hardship policy, or indirectly in terms of advocacy."</p>
      <p>Councillors agreed that water is a priority, particularly as some of the shire's villages are on level four water restrictions.</p>
      <p>"Water is our most important thing," Cr Sue Price said.</p>
      <p>"Moree is lucky at this stage because of bore water but our outlying villages are starting to suffer. Perhaps we could invest in water infrastructure that can be used in the future so that we can secure their water. When you can't turn on your tap and have a shower at night, in the dirt and dust and heat, then things get really sad."</p>
      <p>Another priority for councillors is to keep skilled people in town.</p>
      <p>"Skills retention is really going to suffer," Cr Greg Smith said.</p>
      <p>"I've heard of 60 people who have lost their job in Moree last week. Businesses are putting people off left, right and centre.</p>
      <p>"We mentioned this six months ago, but perhaps there would be a way to supplement people's wages with the Newstart Allowance to keep people in town."</p>
      <p>A skills retention payment and water infrastructure for towns and villages are among the list of drought relief options that council will be investigating and seeking funding for.</p>
      <p>The other options include the already implemented <a href="https://www.moreechampion.com.au/story/6477625/share-the-love-and-support-local-businesses-this-christmas-with-new-gift-card/">Love Local gift card program</a>; waiving library late fees; using drought relief funding to employ people on temporary work employment contracts; rate relief and or rate deferral; tourism campaigns; cash stimulus; a rural water scheme; expand the active kids voucher program; develop an active adults voucher program; a free clothes washing program; Income Equalisation Deposits for rural business; and removing the payroll tax from rural communities.</p>
      <p>Council will be seeking outside financial assistance for these ideas. For example, Mr Witherby said council will be advocating for the guidelines of the recent federal government announcement of an <a href="https://www.moreechampion.com.au/story/6479243/pm-morrison-details-new-drought-package/">extra $1 million in drought funding to drought-affected councils</a> to be broad enough to cover as many of these initiatives as possible.</p>
      <p>"If we are not successful with outside funds it will need to go back to council, noting that we have very limited resources," he said.</p>
      <p>"In addition, we need to work out how each of these suggestions might be implemented in practice, to make sure that they are 'do-able'."</p>
      <p>Council will also be drawing on the <a href="https://www.moreechampion.com.au/story/6491008/latest-round-of-drought-consultations-coming-to-the-region/?cs=1483">state</a> and <a href="https://www.moreechampion.com.au/story/6492288/moree-community-encouraged-to-have-a-say-on-future-drought-fund/?cs=1483">federal</a> drought consultations being held in Moree later this month for ideas and will be advocating for permanent changes to both state and federal policy in terms of the supports that those spheres of government can/should provide.</p>
