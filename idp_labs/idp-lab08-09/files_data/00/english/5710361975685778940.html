      <h1>Stocks - Wall Street Falls After Report That China Uncertain About Trade Deal</h1>

      <p>Investing.com – Wall Street fell on Monday after reports that Chinese officials are pessimistic about a trade deal spooked investors.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/us-30">The Dow</a> was down 27 points, or 0.1%, by 9:46 AM ET (13:46 GMT), while the <a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/us-spx-500">S&amp;P 500</a> lost 6 points, or 0.2%, and the <a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/nasdaq-composite">Nasdaq Composite</a> slipped 31 points, or 0.4%.</p>
      <p>China thinks the possibility of a trade deal is bleak due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s reluctance to roll back trade tariffs, CNBC reported. Futures were in the green earlier over renewed optimism that a deal between the two largest economies in the world is possible.</p>
      <p>"This is a market that's going to live or die by the tone around trade," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York.</p>
      <p>"There is some good news that's baked into this market, so when we get bad news this market's going to roll over," Hogan said.</p>
      <p>Stocks sensitive to trade were lower, with Tesla (NASDAQ:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/tesla-motors">TSLA</a>) falling 0.8%, Apple (NASDAQ:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/apple-computer-inc">AAPL</a>) down 0.5%, IBM (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/ibm">IBM</a>) slipping 0.6% and Caterpillar (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/caterpillar">CAT</a>) tumbling 1.1%.</p>
      <p>FedEx (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/fedex-corp">FDX</a>) fell 1.8%. FedEx CEO Federick Smith challenged the paper’s leadership to a public debate in Washington after the paper reported that the delivery company pays no U.S. tax.</p>
      <p>Qudian (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/qudian-inc">QD</a>) slumped 11.2% after the Chinese lender cut its full-year outlook and its earnings for the last quarter missed forecasts.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Coty (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/coty-inc">COTY</a>) rose 4.1% after the cosmetic company said it was buying a 51% stake in Kylie Jenner's cosmetics and skincare businesses for $600 million. Barrick Gold (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/barrick-gold-corp.">GOLD</a>) gained 1.9% after it said it agreed to sell its 50% stake in Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines to Saracen Mineral Holdings for $750 million.</p>
      <p>In commodities, the <a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/usdollar">US Dollar Index</a>, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was down 0.1% to 97.730 and <a href="https://www.investing.com/commodities/gold">gold futures</a> inched up 0.2% to $1,471.35 a troy ounce. <a href="https://www.investing.com/commodities/crude-oil">Crude oil futures</a> fell 1.2% to $57.14 a barrel.</p>
