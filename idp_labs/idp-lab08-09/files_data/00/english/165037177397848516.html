        <b>The 'Abidal Case' was reopened at the request of the prosecution because of "supposed irregularities' in the liver transplant story which the ex-player received from his cousin. Gerard Armand appeared in court.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Gerard Armand gave evidence as a witness</b> on 8th November. He denies having earned money to donate his liver, but<b> there is still suspicion of him making a financial gain</b> off someone for it. The case has affected Sandro Rosell, the ex-Barca president. Armand gave an interview to 'El Confidencial'. </p>
      <p>When there was doubts over whether Abidal had received his liver, Armand was "astonished". "<b>I'm the one who has given the liver.</b> I couldn't understand eanything. My family came to see me. I was in hospital for a month and a half. And w<b>hen I read that the liver Eric received perhaps wasn't mine</b>, I was stunned. At the beginning, I laughed. I thought, <b>what are these people saying?</b>"</p>

      <p>He denies receiving money for it. "<b>My lawyer came to see me in Barcelona </b>and I told him the same as what I said in court", he continued. He claims that he would not be in the same job if he had earned money for it<b>. Armand says he knew he could not accept money for it </b>and that he did for his cousin, Eric. </p>
      <p>In an interview with 'El Confidencial' he says that Abidal's dad is the brother of his mother and<b> thinks that something untoward may have taken place</b>. "I hope Eric isn't up to speed <b>with what's happening or things could turn very ugly</b>," Armand warned. He, Eric Abidal and Sandro Rosell have all got to appear in court. </p>
      <p>Finally, Armand admitted that<b> his relationship with Abidal has changed</b> because of the incident. He said that they had a very good relationship with Eric, but that is no longer the case. <b>"I haven't heard from him for about eight or nine months</b>. I no longer speak to him. The only thing I want is for this matter to end once and for all <b>so that I can get on with my life</b>," Abidal's cousin concluded. </p>
