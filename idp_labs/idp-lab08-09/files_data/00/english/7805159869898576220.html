      <p>Realme is <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/vivo-realme-xiaomi-samsung-india-smartphone-market-growth-q12019/">growing at an unprecedented rate</a> on the back of high demand in the Indian market. Research firm <i>Counterpoint</i> recently <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/one-brand-thats-defying-global-smartphone-market-slowdown-realme-shows-800-growth-3q-2019/">hailed</a> them for “<i>defying the global smartphone market slowdown</i>” with an eight-fold YoY growth they clocked in Q3 2019 to become the seventh-largest brand by shipments for the said quarter. They recently joined the flagship club with the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/realme-x2-pro-snapdragon-855-plus-64mp-optical-zoom-12gb-ram-ufs-3-0/">Realme X2 Pro</a> which comes with quirks such as a Snapdragon 855+, 64MP quad cameras including a telephoto setup, 90Hz display at a starting price of less than $400. The smartphone is <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/realme-x2-pro-coming-snapdragon-855-plus-90hz-display-64mp-camera/">launching in India next week</a> and along with that, the company will launch another device i.e. the Realme 5s, which has a 48MP quad rear camera.</p>
      <p>Externally, the Realme 5s resembles the Realme 5, which was <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/realme-5-pro-quad-cameras-snapdragon-712-india-europe/">launched in India back in August</a>. A <a href="https://www.flipkart.com/new-launch-from-realme-nov2019-ttt34v9-store">microsite</a> that just appeared online on the Indian e-commerce website Flipkart confirms that the device will launch in India on November 20th i.e. at the same event as the Realme X2 Pro. While the page does not reveal any details about the smartphone, it does glorify the 48MP rear quad camera setup.</p>

      <p>The 48MP camera appears to be the only change on the Realme 5s as compared to the Realme 5, which comes with also features quad cameras but instead with a 12MP primary sensor. It appears that Realme is pulling the same trick as Xiaomi did with the Redmi Note 7. In China, Redmi Note 7 was launched with a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-32mp-48mp-isocell-camera-sensors/">48MP Samsung sensor</a> whereas the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-redmi-note-7-pro-review/">Note 7 Pro (review)</a> came with a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/sonys-imx586-48mp-smartphone-camera/">48MP Sony sensor</a>. The <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-redmi-note-7-pro-go-india-launch/">Indian variant of the Redmi Note 7</a>, however, was launched with a 12MP camera and Xiaomi India later launched the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-redmi-note-7s-48mp-snapdragon-660/">Redmi Note 7S with a 48MP Samsung sensor</a>. In Realme’s case, we’re uncertain if they’ll retain the same 48MP Sony sensor from the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/realme-5-pro-review/">Realme 5 Pro (review)</a> or instead go for the Samsung sensor.</p>
      <p>Besides the camera upgrade, we see a new red color for the Realme 5s. While we cannot be certain about the pricing until the launch date, Realme is most likely to price the smartphone under ₹9,999 (~$140) so that it competes with the recently launched <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-redmi-note-8-pro-miui-11-launch-india/">Redmi Note 8</a>.</p>

        <b>Below is a quick recap of Realme 5 specifications. We’re not sure if there’ll be any other upgrades apart from the camera but we’ll update the article as we learn more.</b>

      <h3>Update: 5,000mAh battery on Realme 5s confirmed</h3>

      <p>The microsite on Flipkart was updated today and it confirms the battery capacity on the upcoming smartphone. The Realme 5s will come with a 5,000mAh battery and this is the same as the Realme 5. We also expect to witness other details revealed one-by-one before the launch and will update the article accordingly.</p>

      <h3>Update 2: Snapdragon 665 SoC and 6.51″ HD+ display</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.flipkart.com/realme-5s-coming-soon-ae323yyy1w-store">microsite on Flipkart</a> for the Realme 5s has been updated again, confirming the Snapdragon 665 SoC and the 6.51″ HD+ display.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WH8Ngz1Zb3c" width="900" height="506" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>While the video above mentions Snapdragon 665 SoC, a teaser image on the same page mentions the use of a Qualcomm Snapdragon 655. However, Qualcomm has not released a Snapdragon 655 — there is a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/qualcomm-unveils-snapdragon-660-and-snapdragon-630-two-upper-mid-tier-socs/">Snapdragon 660</a> and a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/introducing-qualcomm-snapdragon-653-626-427-qualcomm-announces-successors-popular-mid-range-socs/">Snapdragon 653</a>, but nothing in between within that naming scheme. So the image is likely just a simple typo, instead of an indication of a new unannounced Qualcomm SoC.</p>

      <p>The 6.51″ HD+ display is also similar to the 6.5″ HD+ display on the Realme 5.</p>
