      <p>Today, nine Democratic members of congress sent a letter to consulting and accountancy firm, <a href="https://www.ey.com/en_gl">Ernst &amp; Young</a> (EY), questioning the methodology and results of a <a href="https://thisisprivateequity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EY-AIC-PE-economic-contribution-report-10-16-2019.pdf">report</a> on private equity firms contributions to the U.S. economy, that it published together with private equity industry group, <a href="https://www.investmentcouncil.org/">American Investment Council</a> (AIC). In their letter, Senators <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-baldwin-brown-pocan-jayapal-colleagues-unveil-bold-legislation-to-fundamentally-reform-the-private-equity-industry">Elizabeth Warren</a>, <a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/">Bernie Sanders</a>, and <a href="https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/">Tammy Baldwin</a>, together with Representatives <a href="http://bit.ly/2NYL7hS">Mark Pocan</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/2NLoop6">Jesús G. ‘Chuy’ García</a>, <a href="https://tlaib.house.gov/">Rashida Tlaib</a>, <a href="https://jayapal.house.gov/">Pramila Jayapal</a>, <a href="https://schakowsky.house.gov/">Jan Schakowsky</a>, and <a href="https://pressley.house.gov/sites/pressley.house.gov/files/Stop%20Wall%20Street%20Looting%20Act%20One%20Pager.pdf">Ayanna Pressley</a> expressed concern about the way that corporations can wield their influence. “One way they do so is by funding sham research - by consultants and researchers who receive big bucks for their work - to back up their views. These studies are distorted and biased and misused in the regulatory and legislative and regulatory process, lending an air of legitimacy to corporate special pleading. The new EY report, prepared with and for a trade group for the private equity industry, appears to be a picture-perfect example of such sham study.” The legislators see the EY and AIC report as an attack on their sponsorship of ‘<a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-baldwin-brown-pocan-jayapal-colleagues-unveil-bold-legislation-to-fundamentally-reform-the-private-equity-industry">Stop Wall Street Looting Act</a>’ introduced in the House and Senate in July 2019.</p>

      <p>The Democratic legislators sent this letter, because they are rightly concerned about how rapidly private equity firms have grown in the last few years. Private equity firms have investments in every sector of the economy, and thousands of Americans have <a href="http://bit.ly/2YcpDzG">lost their jobs</a> at private-equity backed companies. For example, I wrote last week that <a href="http://bit.ly/2NLoop6">thousands of retail workers</a> have lost their jobs as private equity companies loaded retailers with debt, which then largely influences companies to go bankrupt, when they cannot afford to pay back their loans. I agree with the legislators that the fact that almost 9 million Americans work at private-equity owned companies means that they are vulnerable to private equity executives focus on their high salaries and shareholder returns. Workers have no say on how private equity companies run their acquisitions, and yet are the first to lose their jobs when those acquired companies run into trouble, especially the ones that have significant leveraged loans.</p>
      <p>As I <a href="http://bit.ly/2LYyP89">wrote</a> in early October, the AIC and E&amp;Y report was misleading in trying to describe private equity firms as job creators. In thousands of private equity buyouts, job losses and lower wages resulted two years after the transactions were completed.  According to Eileen Appelbaum, Co-Director of <a href="http://cepr.net/about-us/staff/">The Center For Economic And Policy Research</a>, “The EY and AIC report says that private equity supported 8.8 million jobs. In getting to the 8.8 million jobs figure, EY and AIC count every job at every company in which a private equity firm is a minority investor as private equity employment. If your 401(k) owns 100 shares of UPS stock, does that mean you can take credit for every UPS worker? That’s what this report does.” Dr. Appelbaum, who has researched and written extensively about private equity will <a href="https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hhrg-116-ba00-wstate-appelbaume-20191119.pdf">testify</a> in tomorrow’s House Financial Services Committee <a href="https://financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=404650">hearing</a>, ‘<a href="http://bit.ly/2rWjc9D">America for Sale</a>.’</p>

      <p>I am also pleased that the Democrats pointed out in their letter the study’s inaccurate figure on what workers at private-equity backed firms earn. The study stated that the “average US private equity sector worker earned approximately $71,000 in wages and benefits in 2018.” As I explained in a <a href="http://bit.ly/2qXI4xe">Forbes column</a>, the $71,000 figure is an average of the wages and benefits of all workers employed by private equity owned firms, including the highly paid corporate executives, and those employed by the private equity firms themselves. As <a href="https://chuygarcia.house.gov/sites/chuygarcia.house.gov/files/documents/Updated%20bio%20050319.pdf">Congressman Jesús G. ‘Chuy’ García</a> <a href="http://bit.ly/2NLoop6">told me</a> in a phone conversation two weeks ago, the AIC &amp; EY report “claims that the average employee earns $71,000 on average at private-equity owned firms; they do not tell you the median salary. Factored into the high average figure are the salaries of executives. This is not what regular workers are earning. According to Appelbaum, “the 3.2 million workers in personal services and retail trade that private equity takes credit for, do not make anything like that $71,000 and most don’t have benefits.”</p>
      <p>To better understand EY’s methodology, the Democratic legislators sent a thorough list of questions and requested a response by December 6, 2019.  Importantly, the legislators asked what were the terms and conditions were of the contract between EY and AIC. Legislators rightly want details as to the how much was EY was paid for its work on this private equity report. The legislators also asked if AIC officials obtain copies of drafts or previews of the report prior to it being published and whether any AIC officials or individuals representing AIC or private equity firms provide editorial comments or suggestions and whether they were included in the final report.</p>
      <p>The other questions the legislators posed were:</p>
      <p>*The report your company wrote stated, "The average US private equity sector worker earned approximately $71,000 in wages and benefits in 2018." While the report misleadingly reports these figures as aggregate averages, it also breaks down private equity investments by industry in Figure 3: Economic activity related to the US private equity sector, 2018.</p>
      <p>*The report your company wrote stated, "The US private equity sector directly generated $1.1 trillion of value ·added in the United States in 2018," "transforming [target companies] to operate 'more efficiently and effectively generates returns for the private equity fund, the private equity firm that sponsors the fund, and the fund's limited partner investors," and "[private equity funds generate] returns on its investment by maximizing profits net of interest expenses and payments of the debt principal."</p>
      <p>a. Please describe all inputs to the $1.1 trillion figure in detail.</p>
      <p>b. What baseline was used to determine that the private equity industry created $1.1 trillion in "value added?"</p>
      <p>c. How much money did the private equity industry collect in fees from target companies and limited partners in 2018?</p>
      <p>d. How many jobs were created or lost in private equity-owned companies in each of the industries described in Figure 3 of the report? Please provide a breakdown by state.</p>
      <p>e. You wrote the report in partnership with AIC. For of the funds managed by each of AIC's members, please provide returns in terms of public market equivalent.</p>
      <p>*The report your company wrote stated, "In 2018, the US private equity sector paid $174 billion of federal, state, and local taxes," with $113 billion of this figure being federal taxes.</p>
      <p>a. For each AIC member, please provide how the value of the carry earned by each general partner in each of its firms.</p>
      <p>b. When accounting for store and location closures associated with private equity buyouts and management, what were the associated reductions in tax bases of states and localities?</p>
      <p>c. What percent of the $113 billion were capital gains taxes? Absent the carried interest loophole, how much would these tax payments increase?</p>
      <p>Like many others, I look forward to reading the detailed response from EY. It will certainly shed light into the relationship between consultancies and industry groups.</p>
