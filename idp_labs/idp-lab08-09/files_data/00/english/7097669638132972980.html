      <h1>Michael Bloomberg issues first apology for 'stop and frisk' policy ahead of presidential bid</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:46:45+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 00:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/" target="_blank">Vincent Wood</a></address>
      <p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/MichaelBloomberg">Michael Bloomberg</a> has apologised for his endorsement of the <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/stop-and-frisk">stop and frisk</a> policy utilised by police under his tenure as Mayor of <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/new-york">New York</a>.</p>
      <p>Mr Bloomberg has spoken negatively of the initiative for the first time, ahead of a potential bid for the presidency.</p>
      <p>The policing strategy was disproportionately used against ethnic minorities in the city during his three-term tenure as mayor.</p>
      <p>Now Mr Bloomberg has said he considers it to be a blight on his record – despite defending its use earlier this year as having brought down the crime rate in the city.</p>
      <p>Addressing a black church in Brooklyn, Mr Bloomberg said he was "sorry", adding "I can't change history… however today, I want you to know that I realise back then I was wrong."</p>
      <p>Mr Bloomberg – who served as mayor of the city as both a <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/republican">Republican</a> and an independent, is yet to formally announce his candidacy to run in 2020 under the banner of the <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/democratic-party">Democratic party</a>.</p>
      <p>However he is understood to have registered to appear on ballots in at least one state ahead of the Democratic convention where the nominee is ultimately named – vying for the attention of voters in the Alabama presidential primary.</p>
      <p>Now - much like Joe Biden’s pre-race apology for imposing stiffer sentences on crack cocaine users, and Hillary Clinton’s apology for branding black American youths “super predators” before her 2016 nomination - Mr Bloomberg appears to be distancing himself from a past political manoeuvre accused of harming black communities.</p>
      <p>Attempting to put the decision to expand the policing policy into context, he noted there were around 650 murders a day in the city when he took office in 2001. He said “I was not going to accept that — and I didn't.</p>
      <p>“I was determined to improve police-community relations while at the same time reducing crime even further."</p>
      <p>However, he added: “The fact is, far too many innocent people were being stopped while we tried to do that.</p>
      <p>“The overwhelming majority of them were black and Latino.</p>
      <p>"That may have included, I'm sorry to say, some of you here today. Perhaps yourself or your children, or your grandchildren, or your neighbours, or your relatives."</p>
      <p>It is unclear how far his apology will go in easing anger from communities affected by the policy.</p>
      <p>One activist, DeRay Mckesson, said "It is convenient that Bloomberg suddenly apologises but has done nothing to undo the immense damage he has caused on countless lives.</p>
      <p>"His apology is not accepted."</p>
      <p>Stop and frisk targeted black men with startling regularity. At the policy’s peak under Mr Bloomberg in the first three months of 2012, some 203,500 people were frisked by police.</p>
      <p>Black people made up more than half of the subjects of stop and frisk incidents over that period – 108,097 searches in total – despite the city’s black community making up roughly a quarter of its overall population at the time.</p>
      <p>The number of white people stopped and searched over the same period was 18,387.</p>
      <p>"Under Bloomberg, NYPD increased stop and frisk from 100,000 stops to nearly 700,000 stops per year. Ninety per cent of those impacted were people of colour — overwhelmingly black and brown men," black activist and data scientist Samuel Sinyangwe tweeted on Sunday.</p>
      <p>"Bloomberg personally has the money to begin paying reparations for this harm. 'Sorry' isn't enough."</p>
      <p>Renowned civil rights activist Reverend <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/al-sharpton">Al Sharpton</a> however applauded Bloomberg for reversing his stance - though he added that he would have to "wait and see whether it was politically motivated."</p>
      <p>"As one who helped lead countless demonstrations, marches and rallies to amplify the racial impact that was had on the Black and Brown community from stop-and-frisk policing, I am glad to see Mr Bloomberg now admit that the policy was wrong," Rev Sharpton said.</p>
      <p>"It will take more than one speech for people to forgive and forget a policy that so negatively impacted entire communities."</p>
