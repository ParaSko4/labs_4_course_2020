        <b>The Envision Virgin Racing Formula E squad has completed the expansion of its Silverstone base, which team boss Sylvain Filippi says is aimed at "future-proofing" the operation.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Virgin first moved its FE operations base from Donington Park to a unit in the Silverstone Park industrial unit opposite the grand prix track in 2017, and has since been upgrading its facilities.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the start of the 2019-20 season, it has added an upper floor area that houses a new driver-in-the-loop simulator, engineering platform and a conference room.</p>
      <p>The final phase of the expansion - with the building now able to house 25 permanent staff, Virgin's two Audi-powered race cars and the extensive spare parts FE teams require - was enabled by investment from the Envision renewable energy company, which <a href="https://www.autosport.com/fe/news/135638/virgin-sells-majority-stake-in-formula-e-team%20AND%20https://www.motorsport.com/formula-e/news/chinese-firm-acquires-majority-stake-in-virgin-racing-1031005/3068442/">bought the majority stake</a> in the team in April 2018.</p>
      <p>"The short term benefits [are clear], but the bigger benefits will be longer term," Filippi told Autosport about the new base, which will complement Virgin's London commercial office.</p>
      <p>"Future-proofing is exactly what it is. This championship is going to be more competitive.</p>

      <p>"Now we are pretty much at probably peak competitiveness in terms of [number of] teams, right? It doesn't get more crazy than the four German OEMS, plus Nissan and the rest.</p>
      <p>"It's not going to get more than that. But these guys are going to get better.</p>
      <p>"I think season six [2019-20] is going to be very hard and very interesting. But seven and eight, even more so.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>"Because these big guys, after a year of knowledge and data and so on, they'll step up a gear again.</p>
      <p>"For me, it's all about building the structure, so I do whatever I need to do to stay at that level."</p>
      <p>Virgin finished third in the standings in 2018-19 - its first season as an Audi customer squad after completing three championships as the DS works squad.</p>
      <p>Filippi says he is "absolutely sure we can run this team from this space for the next 10 years - no problem at all" even if Virgin were to switch powertrain suppliers or build its own technology in the future.</p>
      <p>"If we were to work with a different car manufacturer in the long-term future, whether as a customer team or as a full works entry, then the scope of work would change hugely," he added.</p>
      <p>"We could never do a full powertrain R&amp;D from here because it's not geared up for it.</p>
      <p>"But it could happen [nearby] very easily - being based at Silverstone allows you to do that too easily through R&amp;D, simulation, suppliers."</p>
