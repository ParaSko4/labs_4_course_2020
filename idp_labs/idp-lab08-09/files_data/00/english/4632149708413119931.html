      <p><i>Bangalore Apartments' Federation will launch group insurance that will offer a coverage of about Rs 2 lakh<br/></i><br/>The Bangalore Apart-ments’ Federation (BAF) will be launching group insurance for domestic workers to make them feel part of the formal and organised employment sector. The employers of these workers would pay part of the amount for an insurance cover of about Rs 2 lakh. <br/><br/>Srikanth Narasimhan, General Secretary of BAF said, " We will launch the MADHURA (Medical Aid for Domestic workers Under Residential Apartments) scheme. It's a group insurance scheme. The premium can be paid by both their employers and domestic workers." <br/><br/>The federation has been working on this concept for close to a year and they have received immense response. However, details of the plan are yet to be finalised. <br/><br/>Vikram Rai, treasurer, BAF said that they are keeping the model flexible. <br/><br/>"It's a group insurance programme under the aegis of BAF. We are planning for the best value at the lowest cost possible. The premium can be paid partly by the employer and partly by the domestic worker. Usually, a domestic worker works at three to four apartments and hence, if the premium amount is Rs 2,000, it can be divided among these employers. The insurance would cover the entire family,” he said. <br/><br/>Domestic workers are employed informally and do not have access to the benefits like ESI or group insurance, which are available for those working in the formal sector. This typically leaves them exposed when a disease/accident affects one of the family members and they cannot afford the cost of hospitalisation. <br/><br/>Rai said, “For immediate relief and a lesser cost, they then end up going to quacks. They are not aware of their right to health. I feel they are like invisible essentials. They play a vital role in our daily routine and upkeep.” <br/><br/>HA Nagaraja Rao, president of BAF, said that most of the domestic workers do not get coverage under government schemes like Ayushman Bharat or Arogya Karnataka as they might be above the poverty line or do not fall under the eligible households category as defined under the National Food Security Act. "Hence, there is a need to get their health insurance covered through alternative mechanisms," he said. <br/><br/>The BAF is a federation with over 500 apartment complexes as members and representing over 1 lakh flats and 3 lakh apartment residents across Bengaluru. <br/><br/>The MADHURA scheme me will be launched during the BAMBOOS (Bengaluru Apartments Making Bengaluru Opera-tionally Outstanding and Sustainable) event, an annual event by BAF on November 24 at Freedom Park by Deputy Chief Minister CN Ashwath Narayan.</p>
