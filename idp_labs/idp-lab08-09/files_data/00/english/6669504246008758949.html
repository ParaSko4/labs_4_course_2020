      <p>REGINA - The Winnipeg Blue Bombers advanced to the Grey Cup with a 20-13 win over the host Saskatchewan Roughriders in Sunday's CFL West Division final.</p>
      <p>The Bombers meet the East Division's Hamilton Tiger-Cats in next Sunday's championship game in Calgary. The Ticats downed the Edmonton Eskimos 36-16 in Sunday's East final.</p>
      <p>Kenny Lawler caught a touchdown pass for Winnipeg and Justin Medlock kicked field goals from 44, 43, 32 and 13 yards for the win.</p>
      <p>Saskatchewan's Brett Lauther kicked field goals from 12, 13, 33 and 42 yards in front of an announced sellout of 33,350 at Mosaic Stadium.</p>
      <p>Saskatchewan topped the West division with a 13-5 record, ahead of the Calgary Stampeders (12-6) and the Bombers (11-7).</p>
      <p>The Roughriders had a bye week while the Bombers defeated the Stampeders 35-14 in the division semifinal last week.</p>
      <p>Winnipeg last played in a Grey Cup in 2011 when the Bombers fell 34-23 to the host B.C. Lions. The Blue Bombers haven't won the CFL's championship trophy since 1990.</p>
      <p>Blue Bombers quarterback Zach Collaros completed 17 of 25 passes for 267 yards and a touchdown pass.</p>
      <p>The West final was his third straight start as a Bomber since he was acquired in a trade Oct. 9 from the Toronto Argonauts.</p>
      <p>Saskatchewan starting quarterback Cody Fajardo played Sunday with an injured oblique muscle.</p>
      <p>He couldn't run the football as aggressively as he did in a 611-yard regular season. Fajardo was 27-for-41 in passing for 366 yards.</p>
      <p>The one-two punch of Collaros and rushing quarterback Chris Streveler that was so effective in a semifinal win over Calgary was deployed less Sunday perhaps due to Streveler's injured foot.</p>
      <p>Streveler, who rushed for 82 yards and a touchdown against Calgary, threw one incomplete pass in his only appearance in the first half.</p>
      <p>Saskatchewan's defence was ready for Streveler to run in the second half, holding him to five yards on three carries.</p>
      <p>Down 20-13 at the three-minute warning, Saskatchewan squandered a pair of golden opportunities to score.</p>
      <p>On a third-and-goal with four seconds left, Fajardo's pass to the end zone bounced off the crossbar to end the game.</p>
      <p>Winnipeg's defence denied Fajardo on a one-yard plunge attempt for a touchdown with 2:37 remaining.</p>
      <p>Trailing 17-7 to start the fourth, the Roughriders had third-string quarterback Bryan Bennett under centre for a short-yardage scoring play.</p>
      <p>A miscommunication cost the hosts a touchdown and Lauther kicked a 12-yard field goal.</p>
      <p>Winnipeg's Winston Rose picked off a Fajardo pass late in the third quarter and ran it back to Saskatchewan's 34-yard line before he was taken down.</p>
      <p>The Roughriders defence held the visitors to Medlock's 44-yard-field goal to cap the quarter.</p>
      <p>Fajardo found his rhythm late in the second quarter with seven passes for 94 yards, but that drive stalled in the red zone.</p>
      <p>The 'Riders settled for Lauther's 12-yard field goal. Medlock's 60-yard punt single gave Winnipeg an 11-4 halftime lead.</p>
      <p>The visitors led 10-1 after the first quarter.</p>
      <p>From their own three-yard line, the Bombers raced downfield on Collaros's 63-yard pass to Darvin Adams, followed by a Saskatchewan roughing-the-passer penalty that moved them another 15 yards, and Collaros's 26-yard throw to Lawler in the end zone.</p>
      <p>Collaros went down holding his left knee when Saskatchewan defensive end Charleston Hughes flew into the quarterback's legs, but the Bombers starter remained in the game.</p>
      <p>The 107-yard touchdown drive was the longest in the CFL playoffs since the 2011 West final, in which Edmonton went 108 yards versus B.C.</p>
      <p>The 'Riders turned the ball over midway through the first quarter. Winnipeg's Steven Richardson recovered a William Powell fumble to give the Blue Bombers the ball on Saskatchewan's 32-yard line.</p>
      <p>Tackles by Saskatchewan's Cameron Judge and L.J. McCray held the Bombers to Medlock's 32-yard field goal.</p>
      <p>Roughrider punter Jon Ryan kicked a 54-yard punt single on Saskatchewan's opening drive of the game.</p>
