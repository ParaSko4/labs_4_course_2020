      <p><b>Topline</b>: A top public relations aide to Prince Andrew quit earlier this month after advising Andrew against participating in a BBC interview about his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the Times of London <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/prince-andrews-pr-man-quit-after-advising-against-interview-gvc59hmql">reported</a>, citing sources close to Buckingham Palace who called the interview, which aired Saturday, a PR disaster. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Jason Stein, who was hired in September to spearhead the effort to rehabilitate Andrew’s image, thought sitting down for a televised interview with BBC journalist Emily Maitlis could backfire.</li>
        <li>Stein instead wanted Andrew, Queen Elizabeth II’s third child, to sit for two print interviews and focus on his charity work, the Times of London reported, but he was ignored.</li>
        <li>Andrew’s private secretary Amanda Thirsk had pushed for him to do the interview as a way to set the record straight and end the controversy that has become an embarrassment for the British royal family. </li>
        <li>Stein’s warning, it appears, largely came true. Royal watchers and critics <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/prince-andrews-epstein-interview-roundly-panned-nuclear-explosion-level-bad/2019/11/17/62b28a02-094b-11ea-8054-289aef6e38a3_story.html">panned</a> Andrew’s interview and was criticized because he looked uncomfortable, gave what some saw as flimsy answers and didn’t express enough, if any, remorse Epstein’s victims.  </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>News peg</b>: Andrew has been swept up in the scandal surrounding the arrest and subsequent suicide of Epstein, the disgraced financier who was indicted for trafficking underaged girls. In addition to having a very public friendship with Epstein, one of his victims, Virginia Giuffre (then Virginia Roberts), alleges that Epstein directed her to have sex with Andrew when she was 17. </p>
      <p><b>Key background</b>: The BBC interview focused on two major allegations. The first was Andrew’s connection to Giuffre, which is supported by a 2001 photograph that shows Andrew’s arm around her waist. Andrew implied in the interview that the photo might be doctored and said he had no recollection of ever knowing Giuffre.</p>
      <p>Andrew was also interrogated about meeting with Epstein even after he was convicted in 2010 of soliciting a minor for postitution. In particular, Andrew has been scrutinized for staying in Epstein’s luxury home for four days in 2010 after the conviction. Andrew told the BBC he stayed there in order to end the friendship in person instead of over-the-phone, a decision, he said, “was probably coloured by my tendency to be too honourable.”</p>
