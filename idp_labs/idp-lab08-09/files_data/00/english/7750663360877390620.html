      <p>Emery finds himself under pressure after managing just one win from his last six games - a spell that has left the Gunners <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/table.html">sixth in the Premier League table.</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/arsenal/sack-race/news/emery-given-six-games-to-save-arsenal-job_378708.html?t1573652712">It is claimed</a> that the Spaniard has one month - or six games - to save his position at the Emirates.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Football London</i>, Arsenal are looking at Enrique as a potential candidate for the role should results fail to improve under the current regime.</p>
      <p>Enrique enjoyed a successful spell as Barcelona manager between 2014 and 2017, winning the treble during his first season at the Camp Nou.</p>
      <p>The 49-year-old, who took over the Spain job after the 2018 World Cup, has been out of work since July in order to spend more time with his family.</p>
