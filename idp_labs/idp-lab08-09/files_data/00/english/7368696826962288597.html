      <p>If you have been on the internet in the past 48 hours, you would have already seen a cute little green alien with giant black eyes on your timeline. Baby Yoda has been trending all over the world after he made his debut in the second episode of Disney’s Star Wars: The Mandalorian.</p>

      <p>So what is Baby Yoda and why are people losing their minds over its cuteness? Well, if you don’t know, Disney+ <a href="https://preview.disneyplus.com/za">launched</a> two weeks ago in the US and along with it the new Star War: The Mandalorian tv show. Unfortunately, here in South Africa, we don’t have Disney+ yet so chances of you knowing who this adorable creature is are quite slim due to the geoblocking restrictions.</p>

      <p>In Chapter 2: The Child, the Mandalorian is tasked with locating and returning a Yoda-looking infant to “the Client”. In fact, this Baby Yoda is actually a 50-year-old creature, which is still a baby because, alien things. This is as much as we know about the creature as we have not watched the episode yet either.</p>
      <p>The episode, which you can watch a rundown of all the best Baby Yoda moments down below, consists of some adorable scenes with this ancient-yet-young alien including him swallowing some food in the cutest way possible.</p>

      <p>Users began sharing their love for the alien on Twitter saying it could be the best thing to ever happen to the Star Wars series in years and we can’t disagree. Many users are swearing an oath to the baby saying they will “lay down their lives for Baby Yoda” similar to what the Mandalorian does throughout the episode of the show.</p>
