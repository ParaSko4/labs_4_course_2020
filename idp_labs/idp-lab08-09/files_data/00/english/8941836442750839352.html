      <p>BALTIMORE (AP) - A Maryland contractor has paid $110,000 to resolve claims that it improperly billed the federal government for computer hardware.</p>
      <p>U.S. Attorney Robert Hur’s office on Monday announced the settlement with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/eagle-alliance/">Eagle Alliance</a>, a government contractor and Northrop Grumman partnership. The contractor’s payment to the government resolved False Claims Act allegations against it.</p>
      <p>The government contends <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/eagle-alliance/">Eagle Alliance</a> periodically billed twice for the same equipment and improperly billed for used computer equipment as if it was new.</p>

        <p>A former <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/eagle-alliance/">Eagle Alliance</a> employee originally sued under whistleblower provisions of the False Claims Act before the government intervened to take over the case.</p>
