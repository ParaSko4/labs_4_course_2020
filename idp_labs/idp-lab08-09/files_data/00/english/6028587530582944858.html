      <p>Though Halloween has come and gone — a time when all things ghoulish and ghostly are top of mind— creepiness is something I think about year-round. Why? As the chief marketing officer at an artificial intelligence (AI) company, I recognize that for some, AI can be a little unnerving.Whether they experience a dash of unease or intense fear that inspires thoughts of AI-powered robots taking over the world, the idea that computers could have humanlike characteristics and intelligence gives some people the heebie-jeebies. AI robots are not about staging a world takeover, but working at a company that builds humanlike virtual assistants, I do recognize the importance of figuring out exactly where the creepy line is for customers.</p>
      <p>As global spending on AI climbs to a <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/retail-spending-on-ai-to-reach-73b-by-2022/516170/">forecasted $7.3 billion</a> in the next three years, understanding consumer sentiment around artificial intelligence is of utmost importance. As technology advances, enabling virtual assistants to become more and more humanlike, here are three steps to ensure your brand’s AI assistants never leave consumers feeling creeped out.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Unpack The Creep Factor </b>
      </p>
      <p>The first step to making sure your virtual assistant avoids causing unpleasant feelings is to appreciate what can cause them. Staunch defendants of the value of artificial intelligence — people who understand how it works, its value and the benefits it delivers — may be too quick to discredit the potential for “skin-crawly” feelings toward the technology. In reality, the response is rooted in a psychological concept that’s been discussed for decades. It’s called the uncanny valley, and it’s not limited to AI-powered interactions.</p>
      <p>By <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/uncanny-valley">definition</a>, the uncanny valley “describes the feelings of unease or revulsion that people tend to have toward artificial representations of human beings.” Imagine seeing a mannequin in a shop window that looks eerily lifelike, so much so that, at first glance, you think it’s a human. That moment when you realize it’s a plastic figure, you’re taken aback — that’s the uncanny valley. The uncanny valley is what you’re trying to prevent your customers from experiencing when they interact with an AI-powered extension of your brand.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Navigate The Uncanny Valley</b>
      </p>
      <p>Next, focus on building solutions that keep consumers from dipping into the uncanny valley. When consumers encounter a virtual assistant that behaves in a way that is so humanlike that it almost fools them, it can result in apprehension and negative feelings toward AI. No one should feel duped by an AI system, and companies that deploy smart technologies should do everything they can to prevent instances where consumers may believe they have been misled.</p>
      <p>I believe that a virtual agent should never attempt to mislead the consumer into thinking it’s an actual person. Not only is it perceived by many to be unethical, but it’s also proven to be unproductive. In 2018, my company worked with The Harris Poll to survey more than 2,000 consumers and found that 40% of them find it more creepy than helpful when an AI-powered customer service agent acts like a human but doesn’t notify the caller that it’s a virtual assistant. That’s why we always advise our clients to tell their customers when they will be interacting with a virtual agent. As technology advances, enabling more and more realistic virtual assistants, transparency in the use of virtual agents will only become more important.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Keep The Creepy Line At Bay</b>
      </p>
      <p>Finally, as smart technologies continue to develop, regularly consider how they will impact the consumer experience, and how they can be deployed to be as well received and mutually beneficial as possible. Powered by the rapid development of AI, natural language processing and machine learning, virtual assistants are getting better and better, which means they’re getting more humanlike, and more at risk of being creepy. Not only are virtual assistants mirroring humans in voice and in text on a screen, but they are also starting to credibly look and behave like humans, too.</p>
      <p>I recently sat down with Gabriel Skantze, the cofounder of a social robot company, to record an episode of my company’s AI podcast, <i>The ConversAItion</i>. Gabriel’s company creates AI-powered social robots that are humanlike in both appearance and behavior. I asked how people respond to social robots and what his leadership team does to avoid making people feel uneasy in their presence.</p>
      <p>What I learned is that many humanoid robots have an incredibly realistic appearance, so you expect to see the same lifelike accuracy in their microexpressions; but microexpressions are very difficult to achieve in robotics. The result is a disconnect — a lifelike robot that acts lifeless and draws comparisons to a zombie or the living dead.</p>
      <p>To combat creepiness, Gabriel’s team found a balance between their robots’ appearance and behavior. The movement and expressions of their robots are sophisticated, but their faces are purposefully cartoonish. This balance is reflected in computer animation — cartoonish characters with sophisticated, lifelike movements — and is an approach that is much easier for people to digest.</p>
      <p>As AI technology advances and virtual assistants progress, companies will have to overcome new and ever-evolving hurdles to ensure customer interactions are productive and fully creep-free. With an understanding of what causes feelings of unease, a focus on transparency and an ongoing commitment to deploying humanlike technologies in a way that only positively impacts the consumer experience, brands will be able to implement AI solutions that are productive and helpful — without raising goosebumps.</p>
