      <h2>Gang violence and ballot snatching were widely reported during the elections in both states.</h2>

      <p>The Independent National Electoral Commission has concluded governorship elections in Kogi and Bayelsa states but Nigerians have been lamenting the outcome of the exercise.</p>
      <p>Gang violence and ballot snatching were widely reported during the elections in both states. </p>
      <p>Joe Abbah, a governance expert, who was the Director-General of the Bureau of Public Sector Reform between 2013 to 2017, condemned the violent attacks on electorates during the governorship elections.</p>
      <p>He said, “It is truly sad that all the gains that Nigeria made on electoral reforms, particularly between 2010 and 2015, have now been firmly lost. </p>
      <p>“We are back to electoral violence, intimidation and the snatching of ballot boxes.</p>
      <p>"As an advocate of governance reforms, this breaks my heart.”  </p>
      <p>Similarly, Saleh Shehu Ahmed, an Abuja-based journalist, lamented the turn out of the election.</p>
      <p>He said, “This democracy may end up consuming us.</p>
      <p>“With what I saw in Kogi and Bayelsa elections, the future is not bright.”</p>
      <p>Ayodele Fayose, a former governor of Ekiti State, also condemned the elections in the two states.</p>
      <p>He said, “Today is another sad and dark moment for our country and democracy going by the outcome of Kogi and Bayelsa election brazenly rigged in connivance with INEC anf security agencies.</p>
      <p>"The graveyard silence of Nigerians should however, not be mistaken for the consent of these shenanigans. I warned!”</p>
      <p>Seun Onigbinde, co-founder of Budgit, also condemned the violence during the election.</p>
      <p>In a post on Twitter, he chided Seriake Dickson, incumbent governor of Bayelsa State, for the outcome of the election.</p>
      <p>Douye Diri lost the election to the candidate of All Progressives Congress.</p>
      <p>Reacting to the incident, Onigbinde said, “Y'all didn't even know what Dickson did.</p>
      <p>"The two PDP candidates for governor and deputy governor are current members of Senate.</p>
      <p>“So, Dickson planned to leave two Senate slots opened. To what end? The humiliation was a product of greed.”</p>
      <p>Kayode Ogundamisi, a socio-political critic, also blamed the loss of the Peoples Democratic Party in Bayelsa on the lack of infrastructural development in the state. </p>
      <p>In pictures shares on social media, electorates were seen queuing up in heavy flood to cast their votes during the election.</p>
      <p>He said, “All political leaders from Bayelsa State and the Federal Government should cover their heads in shame.</p>
      <p>“For people to come out and vote under these horrible conditions, it means they are filled with pain.</p>
      <p>"A major oil-producing state deserves better.”</p>
      <p>A Twitter user, Dolly Kola, also blamed the leadership of the PDP in Bayelsa State.</p>
      <p>He said, “Not surprised by the Bayelsa elections at all.</p>
      <p>"I'm Jonathan's loyalist, this was his backyard. He knows why the APC candidate deserved to win and why the people chose to revolt against Dickson. I trust his call and judgement.</p>
      <p>"APC won fair and square. Kogi was a sham process." </p>
      <p>Nigerians also expressed shock over pictures of ex-president Goodluck Jonathan, and his wife in a cordial embrace with some APC members and winner of the governorship election in Bayelsa.</p>
      <p>"Jonathan supported APC in Bayelsa? I wonder what his Twitter followers make of that,” Japheth Omojuwa said.</p>
      <p>In Kogi State, the election was equally marred by events of ballot box snatching amongst others. </p>
      <p>Jibrin Ibrahim, a Twitter user, queried the security agencies on their roles in maintaining law and order during the electoral process. </p>
      <p>He said, “Our election observer group went round Kogi yesterday, wondering how armed thugs were allowed to move their vehicles freely and disrupt voting.</p>
      <p>"Where were the 35,000 police allegedly deployed #KogiDeides2019.” </p>
