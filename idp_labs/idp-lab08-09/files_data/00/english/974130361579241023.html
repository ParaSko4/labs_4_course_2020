      <p>With English rugby still reeling after double champions Saracens were hit with a 35-point deduction for salary cap breaches, Eddie Jones feels his test side will be impacted.</p>
      <p>An under-strength Saracens side went down 30-10 against Racing last weekend in the Champions Cup as they look set to prioritise Premiership survival. Mark McCall's outfit supplied six players to the World Cup final starting team and Jones is concerned about the potential consequences.</p>
      <p>"It's something we need to weigh up and look at very carefully," he told BBC Sport.</p>
      <p>"Obviously there may be some dislocation between Saracens players and the rest of the clubs," he added. "That's a reality."</p>
      <blockquote>We may have to work to mend those relationships a bit harder, and there might be some Saracens players who feel like they've got to play for their club instead of their country, to make sure they don't go down. So we'll weigh all those up as they come about.</blockquote>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Captain Owen Farrell, Mako and Billy Vunipola, Jamie George, Maro Itoje and Elliott Daly all started the final in Yokohama.</p>
      <p>With the deduction in place, Saracens are currently bottom of the table 26 points behind 11th place Leicester Tigers.</p>
