      <p>This limited edition collection is for the person seeking a daily “scentspiration”. 15 vials (at 0.12-ounce each) offer a range of unique scents and capture the spirit of Gabrielle Chanel. Each fragrance is named after a story or memory in her life (e.g. Bois Des Iles, Jersey, 1932). And ‘31 Rue Cambon’ is one to note as well, where elegance and warmth is captured in this fragrance - thanks to a mixture of bergamont, patchouli and citrus. The perfume’s name is in honor of a real address in Paris - which not only acted as the very first and flagship Chanel store, but was also the site of Chanel’s famous apartment (located on the second-floor).</p>

      <p>If money is no object, then this collector’s fragrance is for you. At $10,000 USD and only 9 pieces available in the country, it’s the finest expression of beauty and grace. The coffret (box) is crafted by Maison Lesage, embroiderer since 1858 - whose elegant tweed lines the interior, meant to mimic those famous Chinese-lacquered screens. Nestled in the center is the Coromandel perfume - crafted by Chanel’s in-house Perfumer Creator Olivier Polge, and housed in a collectible Baccarat crystal bottle. The wearer of this fragrance will be embraced by what Polge describes as an “Oriental scent” with an amber intensity, that’s fortified with warm musky notes. To finish, draped over the bottle are handcrafted gems by Maison Goossens, goldsmith-jewelers since 1950. Straddling the realms of art and beauty, this is a must-have item for any perfume aficionado.</p>
