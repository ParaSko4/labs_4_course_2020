      <p><b>the project by <a href="http://www.morenoratti.com/product.php?id_product=137&amp;name=sponge">ratti</a> consists of three variously sized pots, ranging in diameter from 10 cm to 22 cm. </b>each piece comprises two elements, the glass bottom and the travertine marble top. as the name suggests, the marble acts to absorb the water in the glass pot below, just like a sponge. the mineral salts present within the holes of the stone are then transported by the water up into the soil and the roots of the plant, allowing the flower to live and flourish.</p>

      <p><b>the simplicity of the design lets the texture of the marble take center stage, while the solidity and weight of the stone provides a strong presence that balances with the transparent glass. </b>moreno ratti is an italian architect and designer born in carrara, italy. since 2013 he has devoted himself to design, specializing in the context of marble.</p>
