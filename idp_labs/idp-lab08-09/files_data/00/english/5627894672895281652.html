      <p>HOLLYWOOD - Ford v Ferrari left its box office competitors in the dust as the historical sports drama from Disney and 20th Century Fox sped into the nations theaters. <br/><br/>Directed by James Mangold and starring Christian Bale and Matt Damon, Ford v Ferrari debuted ahead of expectations thanks to strong word-of-mouth from moviegoers. However, those promising ticket sales werent enough to offset disappointing starts from fellow high-profile newcomers, Charlies Angels and The Good Liar, pushing the domestic box office down over 6% from last year, according to Comscore. <br/><br/>Ford v Ferrari tells the true story of the automotive team at Ford, led by designer Carroll Shelby (Damon) and his British driver Ken Miles (Bale), as they build a race car attempting to beat the legendary Ferrari in the prestigious Le Mans race. <br/><br/>Sonys action comedy Charlies Angels sputtered out of the gate landing in third place between the war drama Midway and Paramounts family film Playing With Fire. Universals romantic comedy Last Christmas rounded out the top five. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Joker officially became the first R-rated movie in history to gross over $1 billion at the global box office.</p>
