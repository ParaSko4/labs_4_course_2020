        <b>A 93rd-minute goal secured more under-17 glory for Brazil on Sunday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Brazil clinched their fourth Under-17 World Cup trophy in thrilling circumstances against Mexico.</p>
      <p>World Cup hosts Brazil triumphed 2-1 thanks to Lazaro Vinicius Marques’ 93rd-minute winner on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Mexico – winners of the showpiece tournament in 2005 and 2011 – looked on track to add a third title to their collection when Bryan Alonso Gonzalez Olivan headed home the opener in the 66th minute.</p>
      <p>But Brazil, playing in front of legends Ronaldo and Cafu, rallied courtesy of Kaio Jorge’s penalty with six minutes of regulation remaining.</p>

      <p>Brazil completed the comeback deep into stoppage time when Lazaro volleyed home the last-gasp winner.</p>
      <p>The victory added to Brazil’s successes in 1997, 1999 and 2003 as they moved within one of Nigeria’s record of five championships.</p>
