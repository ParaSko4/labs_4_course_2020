      <p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/legal/lawyers.htm">Occupational Outlook Handbook</a>, the employment of lawyers is projected to increase by 50,100 from 2018 to 2028. That’s a substantial amount of growth for most occupations, but with the current number of lawyer jobs being 823,900, it’s only an increase of 6%, which is about as fast as the average growth for all occupations. So, it’s not exactly a career path that’s on fire, but neither is it declining.One of the many draws of pursuing a career as a lawyer is the financial compensation; namely, it pays well. Using occupational data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we've analyzed and compiled an overview of the average lawyer salary by state in the U.S. Read on for a full breakdown of where lawyers make the most money, and where they're making the least.</p>
