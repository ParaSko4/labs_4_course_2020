      <h1>This Food Producer Delivers Amazon-Like Customer Experience To Corporate Clients</h1>

      <p>In an increasingly digital world, consumers have high expectations of ecommerce. They want immediacy, quality and most important, they want to be “known.” These expectations carry over into the B2B world, where corporate buyers look for the same experience.</p>

      <p>Global food company <a href="https://www.sigma-alimentos.com/en/">Sigma Alimentos S.A.</a>, based in San Pedro, Mexico, produces almost 2 million tons of food a year which is distributed primarily through supermarkets and convenience stores. It sells meat, dairy and other packaged foods (Yoplait yogurt is one of their most well-known brands) in 18 countries. Overseen by holding company Alfa, Sigma reported sales of US $6.3 billion and profits of $684 million in 2018.</p>
      <p>About nine years ago, the company realized that the hotel and restaurant markets in the region were underserved and created a separate business unit to address the opportunity. Called Sigma Food Service, the division operates solely in Mexico — but is the fastest growing business unit in the company.</p>
      <p>Addiel Amaro, who manages ecommerce development for Sigma Food Service, explains that two years ago Sigma embarked on a digital transformation journey. Each business unit determined which technology made the most sense for their particular operations. Sigma Food Service decided to start with an ecommerce solution that would enhance customer experience while improving efficiency.</p>
      <p>“Our main pain point was easy fulfillment of our customers’ orders and a fast way to let them know when we had expanded the portfolio,” said Amaro. The division wanted to provide a digital catalog that would allow it to launch new products more quickly and help clients understand the breadth of its offerings.</p>
      <p>Previously, when customers placed an order they had to email a sales representative, call the call center, or use a messaging application like WhatsApp. The sales person then needed to manually check which products were in stock.</p>
      <p>Using <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/crm/e-commerce-platforms.html">SAP Commerce Cloud</a>, the team revamped its retail website and put its product portfolio online. Additionally, the team integrated its customer-facing system and back-office applications — also provided by SAP.</p>
      <p>“The system is now intuitive,” said Amaro. “People log in and can browse the catalog. They get personalized offers – and prices are personalized based on their contract with us.”</p>
      <p>One important benefit: buyers for restaurants and hotels can get more accurate product information, including photos and detailed descriptions. Customers can also see the availability of products, and once added to the shopping cart, track where their order is.</p>
      <p>Because the ecommerce system is cloud-based, Sigma has been able to easily plug it directly into its SAP ERP system. Now Sigma’s customers and staff receive real-time information about inventory, logistics and financing. If there’s a shortage of a particular product, the system recommends appropriate substitutions that are in stock.</p>
      <p>“It’s more complex, but it works better because there’s one version of the truth across the whole system,” said Amaro. “It’s crucial for restaurants to get their orders fulfilled. If a pizza parlor runs out of cheese one day, the next day they’re out of business. This is one way that digitizing business processes creates continuous improvement – and allows us to react in time to exceed our customers’ expectations.”</p>
      <p>So far, Sigma says customers love the new platform and since it went live, sales have increased by 15 – 20 percent. But one challenge has been getting staff to use it.</p>
      <p>“Culturally, people feel like technology can be a barrier to sales versus doing business face-to-face,” said Amaro. “But we hope this moves people beyond operational transactions so they can do more strategic work.”</p>
