      <p>Every matchup feels like a must-win from here on out for fantasy football owners, and knowing the latest RB injury updates on Sunday morning are key to making those last-minute start 'em, sit 'em decisions. Heading into Week 11, Jordan Howard, Damien Williams, David Montgomery, Le'Veon Bell, and Raheem Mostert are all "questionable" (with Matt Breida listed as "doubtful" and Ty Johnson not on the Lions final injury report), so we'll provide the latest news on them right here throughout the day.</p>

      <h3>Is Jordan Howard playing Week 11?</h3>
      <p><b>UPDATE: </b>Howard is officially OUT.</p>
      <p>Howard (stinger) was limited in practice in practice all week and is officially "questionable" for Sunday's game against the Patriots. ESPN's Adam Schefter reported late Saturday night that Howard is <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1195929060574150657">not expected to play</a>.</p>
      <p>With a 4:25 p.m. ET kickoff, fantasy owners need to have a late-game/prime-time fill-in ready if they want to wait out Howard. Given the tough matchup, Howard probably isn't worth waiting for anyway, so go ahead and start someone from the early games if he has a better matchup. Miles Sanders would see additional touches and a worthwhile FLEX if Howard is out, with Jay Ajayi mixing in and likely getting a decent amount of carries.</p>

      <h3>Is Damien Williams playing Monday night?</h3>
      <p><b>UPDATE: </b>Williams <a href="https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1196098755478663171">rejoined the Chiefs</a> and is expected to play Monday night.</p>
      <p>Williams (personal reasons) was listed as "questionable" for Monday night's game against the Chargers, but Chiefs coach Andy Reid said the starting RB "<a href="https://twitter.com/ByNateTaylor/status/1195780581549850624">should</a>" make the trip to Mexico City with the team.</p>
      <p>We will know Sunday whether Williams made the trip, and as long as he does, he'll worth starting as an RB2. If he doesn't, look for LeSean McCoy and Darrel Williams to get additional touches, making both legitimate FLEX options.</p>

      </p>
      <h3>Is David Montgomery playing Week 11?</h3>
      <p><b>UPDATE: </b>Montgomery is officially ACTIVE.</p>
      <p>After rolling his ankle in practice on Wednesday, Montgomery missed practice on Thursday and got in a limited session on Friday. He's "<a href="https://twitter.com/BearsPR/status/1195419424301486080">questionable</a>" for Sunday night's game against the Rams.</p>
      <p>Montgomery looks like a true game-time decision, and given the timing of the game, most owners likely can't afford to wait for him. If he's out, Tarik Cohen and Ryan Nall would likely split RB touches, so unless you have one of them or can pick up someone like Darrel Williams, it's not worth it to wait on Montgomery.</p>

      <h3>Le'Veon Bell injury update</h3>
      <p><b>UPDATE 2: </b>Bell is officially ACTIVE.</p>
      <p><b>UPDATE: </b>Bell is <a href="https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1195991716060262400">expected to be active</a> today, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport.</p>
      <p>Bell (ribs, illness) practiced on a limited basis all week and is officially "<a href="https://twitter.com/MMehtaNYDN/status/1195365573825323009">questionable</a>" for Sunday's game against the Redskins.</p>
      <p>After playing through a knee injury last week, it seems likely Bell will suit up against Washington. If he doesn't, Bilal Powell will handle the majority of the RB touches.</p>

      </p>
      <h3>Raheem Mostert injury news</h3>
      <p><b>UPDATE: </b>Mostert is officially ACTIVE.</p>
      <p>Mostert (knee) was limited in practice all week and is "<a href="https://twitter.com/Cardschatter/status/1195463191049826304">questionable</a>" for Sunday's late-afternoon game against Arizona.</p>
      <p>Because Matt Breida (ankle) is "doubtful" Mostert's status matters. He would be in line for about a dozen touches as the complementary back to Tevin Coleman. If Mostert is also out, Jeff Wilson Jr. would likely operate as San Francisco's No. 2 and could be a sneaky FLEX play in standard leagues.</p>
