      <p>Wellington.Scoop<br/>Train services between Wellington and Porirua have been replaced by buses today because of another electrical fault in the overhead power lines.</p>
      <p>This time the fault is south of Takapu Road.</p>
      <p>Metlink says only a limited number of buses is available to carry the displaced train passengers.</p>
      <p>And there are only a limited number of trains between Porirua and Waikanae.</p>
      <p>Metlink buses will be accepting rail tickets on their regular bus routes.</p>
      <p>But Metlink suggests that its travellers should arrange alternative transport where possible. (Which is never a helpful suggestion.)</p>

      <p>More details from Metlink:</p>
      <p>At 12.30pm on Monday an overhead power outage occurred on the Kapiti line near Takapu Road. This meant all services were suspended between Wellington and Takapu Road. A traction crew were sent to assess the issue. The power fault was with the overhead wires on the northbound tracks only, the second southbound track was undamaged; however, the power in the entire stretch of line needed to be switched off to enable crews to repair the overhead.</p>
      <p>We have contacted every bus operator in the Wellington Region and have all the available buses assisting Kapiti passengers.</p>
