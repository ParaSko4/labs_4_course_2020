      <p>In science there are little mysteries, like better understanding a particular chemical reaction, and big ones, like the fact that researchers have only been able to identify a mere five percent of the energy and matter in the universe. That five percent is what is needed to explain the light emitted from every galaxy in Sagan’s oft-misquoted “billions and billions.” But the remainder is a combination of dark energy and dark matter, two substances whose existences have been merely inferred and not directly observed. <a href="https://ieeetv.ieee.org/conference-highlights/new-results-g2-axion-dark-matter-experiment?">A recent study</a> has added to what we know about dark matter.An experiment called <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/admx/index.shtml">ADMX</a>, hosted by the University of Washington, is using very powerful magnets to search for a candidate dark matter particle called an axion. (Disclosure: The author is employed by <a href="http://www.fnal.gov/">Fermilab</a>, which is the lead Department of Energy laboratory on ADMX. He is not directly involved with the experiment.)</p>
      <p>Dark matter is thought to be about five times more prevalent than ordinary matter. It is massive and affects the motion of the universe through gravitation, but it gives off no light, not does it participate in any of the other known subatomic forces.  But it certainly seems to be there, as galaxies rotate too quickly and individual galaxies within larger clusters of galaxies should fly away instead of being bound together in a cluster.</p>

      <p>For decades, the betting scientist would have wagered that dark matter was made up of what are called WIMPs, short for Weakly Interacting Massive Particle. WIMPs were thought to be kind of like stable neutrons, floating around in a diffuse cloud in space – with each particle having the mass in the range of the mass of a neutron to as much as a few thousand times heavier.</p>
      <p>But experiments designed to see WIMPs came up empty, leading other candidate particles to be considered. One of these is called an axion. The axion also has not been discovered but it could fit the bill as the real form of dark matter. </p>
      <p>In 1977, physicists Helen Quinn and Roberto Peccei proposed a physics model that solved a question about the behavior of the strong nuclear force. The strong nuclear force treats matter and antimatter on an equal footing, and it didn’t have to. Quinn and Peccei’s model solved that mystery. Two other physicists by the name of Steven Weinberg and Frank Wilczek realized that this new theory predicted a particle now called the axion and it could also be dark matter.</p>
      <p>If they exist, axions are incredibly light compared to other particles. If you use the neutron to set the mass scale – meaning that we say that neutrons have a mass of 1, electrons (which are the lightest particle to have their mass precisely measured) have a mass of 0.0005. Axions, on the other hand, are thought to have a mass more like a quadrillion times smaller than a neutron.</p>
      <p>If axions are dark matter, they do not typically interact via the electromagnetic force, but there is a way to urge them to manifest themselves electromagnetically. Researchers make a very strong magnetic field and the axions can interact with that magnetic field and become photons. Inside the magnet sit detectors that can register the appearance of photons. The trick is to shield the apparatus enough that other stray photons won’t be detected.</p>
      <p>ADMX would have seen axions in the mass range of 2.7 – 3.3 microelectron volts (2.7 – 3.3 × 10<sup>-6</sup> eV). In contrast, the electron has a mass of 5.1× 10<sup>5</sup> eV and the proton has a mass of 9.4 × 10<sup>8</sup> eV. Since ADMX did not see axions with this mass, researchers can rule out this range. An upcoming run will extend the range to higher masses – perhaps as much as 40 × 10<sup>-6</sup> eV.</p>
      <p>Scientists are convinced that dark matter must exist, and they have a good idea of the total amount of dark matter in the universe. But they have no real idea as to the mass of individual dark matter particles. The mass of axions is much lower than the WIMPs that have long been popular in scientific circles, but the fact that WIMPs have not been observed means that scientists must cast a wider net. Axions are a credible alternative and experiments like ADMX will continue</p>
