      <p>Johannesburg – South African banks have confirmed that businesswoman, Bridgette Motsepe-Radebe was not a signatory on bank accounts allegedly set up for illicit money flows to effect regime change in Botswana.</p>
      <p>Nedbank, ABSA and Standard Bank have cleared her of claims in the so-called “Butterfly” case against Motsepe-Radebe’s alleged co-conspirator, former Directorate of Intelligence and Security Services (DIS) agent, Welhemina Mphoeng Maswabi.</p>
      <p>Motsepe-Radebe welcomed the clearance, adding she was a victim of a smear campaign.</p>
      <p>“It is quite apparent that all of these wild claims about me are part of what has already been exposed as a state sponsored smear campaign that is being executed by the intelligence operatives of the government of Botswana”, said Motsepe-Radebe in a statement released by Vincent Magwenya on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“I therefore call on the authorities in Botswana to investigate all of these claims against me and to probe the evident abuse of state resources against private individuals. I am also calling on the South African authorities to investigate the veracity of these claims since I am alleged to have committed crimes from South Africa against a neighbouring country. As I have done with engaging the banks to expose the truth, I will continue fighting to clear my name. The defamation case against the Standard newspaper in Botswana will also commence soon,” said Motsepe-Radebe.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Motsepe-Radebe and Sandton businessman known as Malcolm X were accused of being at the centre of a plot to topple Botswana President Mokgweetsi Masisi.</p>
      <p>Botswana-based newspaper Sunday Standard published a series of damning articles linking Motsepe-Radebe and ‘Malcolm X’ to a detailed plot that also allegedly involved former Botswana president Ian Khama.</p>
      <p>According to the paper, the plotters wanted Masisi to be replaced with former cabinet minister Pelonomi Venson-Moitoi, who was reportedly Khama’s preferred candidate ahead of the congress that was held in Kang in April this year.</p>
