      <p>The Irish playwright gifted the ring to a close friend back in 1876.</p>

      <p>Known for its striking design, with the ring shaped like a belt and buckle, it emerged that the ring had been linked to the 2015 Hatton Garden burglary.</p>
      <p>In fact, when it was stolen, no one knew it was linked to the Irish writer.</p>
      <p>“I was given the ring right in front of the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit,” Crump told <i><b>The Metro</b></i>, adding “which I thought was a bit of English humour.”</p>
      <p>The ring is set to be returned to Oxford University as part of a special ceremony this December</p>
      <p>Commenting on the discovery, Mark Blandford-Baker, home bursar of Magdalen College, said: “Very pleased to have back a stolen item that forms part of a collection relating to one of our more famous alumni.”</p>
