      <h1>Dividend growth slows in third quarter as profit slowdown bites</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:01:43+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author">James Booth</a></address>
      <p>Dividend growth has slowed globally, according to figures published today by asset manager Janus Henderson.</p>
      <p>The trend began in the second quarter and continued into the third.</p>
      <p>Dividends have still continued to grow, but at a slower pace than previously.</p>
      <p>Payouts rose 2.8 per cent on a headline basis to reach a third-quarter record of $355.3bn (£275bn).</p>

      <p>On an underlying basis, dividends grew 5.3 per cent.</p>
      <p>UK dividend growth remained lacklustre, with underlying growth of 0.6 per cent.</p>
      <p>US dividends grew eight per cent on an underlying basis, but a slowdown in profit growth began to make its effect felt.</p>
      <p>One-in-six US companies held their dividends flat in the third quarter, up from one-in-10 in the first quarter.</p>
      <p>The largest dividend payer in the US this year is set to be AT&amp;T, jumping ahead of Apple, Exxon Mobil and Microsoft.</p>

      <p>AT&amp;T returns to the top spot for the first time since 2012, thanks to its acquisition of Time Warner in 2018.</p>
      <p>The combined company will distribute close to $14.9bn, although not be enough to dislodge Shell as the world’s largest dividend payer for the fourth year in a row.</p>
      <p>Janus Henderson has left its $1.43 trillion forecast for global dividends unchanged for 2019.</p>
      <p>This represents a headline increase of 3.9 per cent, equivalent to underlying growth of 5.4 per cent. In 2018 underlying growth was 8.5 per cent.</p>
      <p>This year will mark the tenth consecutive year of underlying growth for dividends.</p>
