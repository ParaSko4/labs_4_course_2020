        <b>SC Paderborn winger Christopher Antwi-Adjei cannot wait to don the Ghana jersey for the first time on Monday. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The 25-year-old German-born earned a debut call-up for the games against South Africa and Sao Tome and Principe.</p>
      <p>But he joined his teammates late due to delays in him acquiring a Ghanaian passport.</p>
      <p>He could not make the match day squad for the 2-0 win over the Bafana Bafana but hoping he gets a look for the match against the Seleção dos Falcões e Papagaios.</p>
      <p>''It will be a dream come true. I really can't wait to start for Ghana against Sao Tome on Monday,'' Antwi-Adjei told footballmadeinghana.</p>
      <p>''I couldn’t play against South Africa in the opening game because of issues with my passport but I really can’t wait to see myself playing for Ghana.''</p>
