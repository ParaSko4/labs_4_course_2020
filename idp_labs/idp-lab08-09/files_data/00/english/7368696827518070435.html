      <h1>KOODOO.co.za Could Be Our New Favourite Local Gaming Retailer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Marco Cocomello</a></address>
      <p>KOODOO.co.za is a fairly new online retailer in South Africa. They are run by GameFinity, the same team that ensures the PlayStation brand is well represented in the country. KOODOO approached me to try and put their service to the test and order something off their <a href="http://bit.ly/KOODOO">online store</a>. Knowing the brand deals with PlayStation (yes, I am a fanboy), I was super excited to splurge on something new because treat yo self!</p>
      <p>KOODOO deals with a lot of products that I could have in my life including a fancy new Rose Gold DualShock 4 controller, or maybe the headset or no, maybe a Cable Guys controller holder. You get the idea here that it was tough to nail down just what I wanted to buy. Full discloser, KOODOO sampled me with an R800 voucher towards the purchase. This meant if I was going to buy something, I was going to go all in.</p>
      <p>I have had my eye on a digital copy of Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch Remastered for some time now so I could have purchased two R500 PSN vouchers off their site. However, chatting to the customer support which pops up on the site and replied super fast, they told me the vouchers are physical objects which they ship to you and not codes they email you. Hopefully, this changes as I am not the only one that quickly needs a PSN voucher and hopes to buy it online and get the credit code emailed to you as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Knowing I had to wait for the PSN credit vouchers to arrive in order to redeem the codes put me off them so I then opted for the next best thing.</p>

      <p>While playing<a href="https://www.glitched.africa/death-stranding-review-a-generation-defining-experience/"> Death Stranding</a> for all those weeks while I prepped my review, one thing irritated me. I use a Nacon Revolution Pro Controller 2 and I have known there was a better model out on the market that was wireless which could save me from running a three-meter cable across my room. So the decision was clear from the moment I saw the new controller on the site.</p>
      <p>Sure, it costs R2,499 but with free shipping or the option to collect the order in a timely manner was an added perk of shopping on on the site. KOODOO offers free shipping for orders over R450 which is great as eighty percent of their products are over that price. Gaming is not cheap at all, we all know this.</p>
      <p>Creating an account was super fast with an email and password required. I searched the product, added it to my cart and proceeded to checkout. KOODOO has various ways to make a payment with Visa and Mastercard, Instant EFT, SCODE which lets you make payment at Checkers or a Post Office, and Mobicred.</p>

      <p>I quickly went through the checkout, filled in my details (Chrome made it easier with autofill) chose delivery and within a minute, payment was made. I do love the fact that you can collect your order from KOODOO itself. They are based in Sandton which is fairly central. In short, as long as you place your order before 12:00 pm, you can collect it the next day.</p>
      <p>Luckily I placed my order for delivery before 12:00 pm so it was dispatched and delivered on the same day. Something I would usually have to pay R100 to R120 to Takealot in order to attempt to get right. No really, same-day delivery within hours of me placing my order. Speaking to the delivery guy, he told me that as long as it is placed fairly early and falls under the central Johannesburg area, they try and get it delivered on the same day.</p>
      <p>Else, it is done first thing in the morning. Outlaying areas will, of course, take a day or two but if you are lucky, you can pay and have your product at your door for no extra charge on the same day.</p>

      <p>So the box arrived with the controller inside, I was super happy about it arriving so fast. It also came with Fallout 4 stickers which I immediately slapped all over my laptop and iPad. There was also a Fallout keyring and a lanyard. Just the smaller details that made this package feel like it is from a gamer to another gamer. These little things you rarely find elsewhere.</p>
      <p>I have honestly been avoiding online shopping for a long time now. I see online retailers delaying day one launches of big games like Death Stranding and it gets to me. The service, in general, has become unreliable so for me to order something, get it on the same day and delivered with a smile (and extra goodies) was out of this world.</p>
      <p>Everybody has their own set retailer but when it comes to gaming, give KOODOO South Africa a go. You might be surprised by just how fantastic and easy the whole experience is.</p>
