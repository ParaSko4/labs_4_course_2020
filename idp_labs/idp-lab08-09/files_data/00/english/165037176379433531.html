        <b>Top-flight female footballers in Spain have agreed to suspend a playing strike after securing an agreement to reopen negotiations over pay, it was announced on Monday.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>All eight Primera Division matches on Saturday and Sunday had to be postponed</b> as players chose to boycott fixtures following more than a year of unsuccessful talks with Spanish unions and clubs. But the Association of Women's players (AFE) has confirmed <b>negotiations will resume until December 20</b>.</p>
      <p>"After the success of the strike, <b>an agreement has been reached</b> to work on the proposal," said the AFE.</p>

      <p>Players are demanding part-time salaries<b> be worth a minimum of 12,000 euros</b> ($13,297), which is 75 percent of the minimum amount for full-time contracts. <b>Clubs had proposed part-time salaries of 8,000 euros </b>but the AFE has suggested the Association of Women's Football Clubs (ACFF) is prepared to give way.</p>
      <p>"Due to the strike,<b> the footballers have managed to remove the red lines </b>around the 75 percent for part-time contracts and 16,000 euros minimum salary," the AFE added.</p>
      <p>Ainhoa Tirapu, goalkeeper for Athletic Bilbao and the Spanish national team, said last month: "<b>We are footballers 24 hours a day</b>, 100 percent of the time. We hope to reach an agreement at some point but <b>we had to take drastic action </b>because the time for women's football is now."</p>
