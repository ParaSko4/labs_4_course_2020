      <p>SoftBank’s embattled Vision Fund isn’t done trying to mint new tech unicorns—if it looks like they’re at least close to turning a profit.Missouri-based EquipmentShare is in talks to raise at least $150 million in a new funding round led by SoftBank, according to prospectus<b> </b>documents viewed by <i>Forbes</i>. These indicate that the new round, if completed, would give the construction tech startup a post-money valuation of at least $1.5 billion and would increase the startup’s total fundraising to at least $220 million. </p>
      <p>Softbank is a favorite to lead the investment, though the deal has not yet been signed and the terms, as well as lead investor, could still change or fall through. At least one offer had been made at a valuation of $1.7 billion post-money, according to the documents, though it could not be determined whether that offer was SoftBank’s. EquipmentShare has already raised $70 million from backers including Insight Venture Partners, Great Oaks Venture Capital and Romulus Capital and was previously valued at about $400 million, according to data from PitchBook.</p>
      <p>SoftBank declined to comment. EquipmentShare cofounder and president William Schlacks sent a statement that called the information “fairly inaccurate” but declined to elaborate.</p>
      <p>The investment in EquipmentShare would be smaller than the checks usually written by SoftBank’s Vision Fund, the $100 billion fund launched by billionaire Masayoshi Son in 2017, which quickly made waves in the tech and financial sectors for cutting billion-dollar checks to high-growth startups. The collapse of portfolio-company WeWork’s IPO and its drop in private valuation, alongside Uber’s disappointing stock performance, led to Softbank posting its largest-ever quarterly loss <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-books-loss-of-4-7-billion-on-wework-investment-11573024776">in November</a>. Softbank has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbanks-vision-fund-tries-to-lower-risk-11572007415">reportedly contacted</a> portfolio companies urging them to trim costs and pursue profit in the weeks since WeWork’s IPO plans collapsed; a second fund, which <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-15/softbank-s-second-vision-fund-is-starting-life-a-lot-smaller">reportedly</a> recently raised a smaller $2 billion first close, is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/rajeev-misra-built-softbanks-vision-fund-now-he-has-to-save-it-11572536439">expected</a> to follow a more cautious approach. </p>

      <p>EquipmentShare is on track<b> </b>to achieve $300 million in revenue this year, according to the documents, on $150 million in EBITDA profits, a measure of earnings that strips out accounting, taxes and financing expenses. Achieving healthy operating profits is a key step to GAAP profits and is a milestone that stands in sharp contrast to many money-losing tech startups. (EquipmentShare’s GAAP financials could not be ascertained.) It would represent a new breed of unicorn for SoftBank, which has been dinged by Uber and WeWork, which both lost more than $1 billion last quarter and are far from generating EBITDA profit.</p>
      <p>EquipmentShare quintupled its sales over the past year and expects to more than double revenue again in 2020, according to the documents.</p>
      <p>Should SoftBank ultimately lead the deal, the investment would signal that some startup founders aren’t shying away from association with the Vision Fund, despite its recent negative publicity—and that some remain intrigued by Son and his firm’s long-term vision and business contacts.</p>
      <p>Dubbed the “Airbnb for construction equipment,” EquipmentShare helps construction companies rent everything from aerial lifts and diggers to power tools and signs. The company, which maintains rental facilities in 17 U.S. states and in New Zealand, according to its website, also sells tracking software that monitors the equipment’s engines so employers can get alerts on when a machine is running low on fuel or how safe a driver is operating the equipment.</p>
      <p>EquipmentShare was founded in 2014 by two brothers, William and Jabbok Schlacks, alongside three other cofounders. “As contractors ourselves, we often faced the frustration of having to source equipment for our projects and debate between purchasing a machine that may only get used a few times a year (and requires maintenance, upkeep) or renting that piece of equipment for a sizable fee,” William Schlacks, its CEO, <a href="http://www.project-disco.org/innovation/071417-construction-disruption-qa-with-equipmentshare/">said in 2017</a>. Their solution, a marketplace for renting such tools, graduated from the famed accelerator Y Combinator in 2015. Schlacks told Y Combinator’s blog in 2018: “We’ve pivoted quite a few times—but it wasn’t really an original idea that drove us. It was original pain.”</p>
