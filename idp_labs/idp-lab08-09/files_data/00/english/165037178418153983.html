        <b>In Italy, they are assuring that the Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic is much closer to signing for Bologna to lend a hand to his friend Sinisa Mihajlovic.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It seems that things are becoming clearer and<b> Zlatan Ibrahimovic's future will once again lie in Italy</b>. The striker will thus return to the country where he played the best in his career and where he will be welcomed with open arms.</p>
      <p>Although it seemed like the option of Milan was most probable, in the last few hours 'La Gazzetta dell Sport' has stated the <b>Bologna move is more possible</b>.</p>

      <p>According to the aforementioned source, Zlatan would prefer to join Bologna.<b> He would join to help his friend Sinisa Mihajlovic</b>, who remains in charge of the club despite his serious illness</p>
      <p>According to Bologna's sporting director, <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/z-ibrahimovic-1237/">Ibrahimovic</a> and Mihajlovic have already spoken by phone a few times and in the last few hours,<b> Marco Di Vaio has flown to Los Angeles</b> to offer Zlatan a deal.</p>
      <p>In any case, despite the Bologna offer seeming closer, <b>the Milan return hasn't been ruled out. Zlatan's wife, Helena, wants to live there again </b>and Ibra wouldn't dislike helping a team he loves either and that have been having a disastrous spell the last few years. Everything will be clear in a matter of weeks.</p>
