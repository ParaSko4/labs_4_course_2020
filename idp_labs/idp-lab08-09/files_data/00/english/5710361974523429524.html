      <h1>Forex - Dollar Hits 1-Week Low as Trade Developments Awaited</h1>

      <p>Investing.com - The dollar slid to one- week lows against a currency basket on Monday, as traders awaited fresh indications on whether the U.S. and China are moving closer to a deal to end their trade war which has roiled financial markets and acted as a drag on global growth.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.investing.com/currencies/us-dollar-index">U.S. dollar index</a> edged down 0.11% to 97.77 by 02:23 AM ET (07:23 GMT), its lowest level since Nov. 7.</p>
      <p>Chinese state media Xinhua reported Sunday that the two sides had "constructive talks" on trade in a high-level phone call on Saturday, but gave no further details on the timing of a possible deal.</p>
      <p>"It all sounds promising," said Marshall Gittler Chief Strategist at FX analysis firm ACLS Global. "But China has made rolling back some of the tariffs a precondition for the agreement and it's not clear whether Trump will agree to that...so net-net, it's still up in the air."</p>
      <p>Against the safe-haven <a href="https://www.investing.com/currencies/usd-jpy">yen</a>, the dollar was up 0.17% to 108.91.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.investing.com/currencies/eur-usd">euro</a> was a touch higher at 1.1062.</p>
      <p>Currency traders are awaiting the first major speech by European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde due on Friday for clues on future policy.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.investing.com/currencies/gbp-usd">British pound</a> climbed 0.4% to a two-week high of 1.2946 after Prime Minister Boris Johnson said all Conservative Party candidates at the Dec. 12 election had pledged to back his Brexit deal.</p>
      <p>It was also supported by fresh opinion polls pointing to a Conservative victory.</p>
      <p>The dollar and bonds are likely to be sensitive to minutes of the Federal Reserve's last policy meeting, set to be released on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"The minutes are likely to reiterate that the U.S. economy is 'solid' and that current monetary policy settings are 'appropriate', which would support the dollar," said Joseph Capurso, a currency analyst at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.</p>
      <p>However, he noted the soft report on October U.S. retail sales released on Friday suggested previously strong consumption was showing some cracks.</p>
      <p>"Any further weakness in consumption could warrant a material reassessment of the outlook by the FOMC. Under our baseline, the FOMC would most likely start cutting interest rates again in 2020," said Capurso.</p>
