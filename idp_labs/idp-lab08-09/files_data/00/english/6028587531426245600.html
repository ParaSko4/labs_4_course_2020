      <p>By most all accounts, Minor League Baseball’s marketing initiative “<a href="https://www.milb.com/fans/copa">Copa de la Diversión</a>” has been a rousing success. Started in 2018, the program re-brands teams and hosts events that engage with the Hispanic communities across the country. It started with 33 teams and grew to 72 teams in 2019. When the 2020 season gets underway, the campaign will add more teams to the mix where the total number of clubs engaged with be in excess of 90. Branding sees uniforms, caps, food, and entertainment options that move beyond the scope of single “Hispanic Heritage” nights, to something that allow fans to enjoy games multiple times throughout the season.The names that teams switch to run the gamut. The Albuquerque Isotopes re-brand as the Mariachis de Nuevo México. The Fresno Grizzlies become the Fresno Lowriders. The Down East Wood Ducks will be the Avocados Luchadores de Down East. And the Brooklyn Cyclones switch to the Brooklyn Jefes.</p>
      <p>One name, however, may not sit well with everyone in the Hispanic, Caribbean, and Latin-American communities.</p>
      <p>Since the beginning of the initiative, the Single-A Short Season Everett AquaSox have re-brands themselves as the Conquistadores de Everett as part of Copa de la Diversión. For parts of North, Central, and South America these explorers from Spain and Portugal are seen as the age of discovery by Europeans, but also destroyed cultures and committed countless atrocities in their wake.</p>
      <p>In the Caribbean, many populations were completely wiped out by the conquistadores. In Mexico, Hernan Cortes and Pedro de Alvarado were part of what were called the Cholula Massacre and the Temple Massacre in which thousands of men, women and children were massacred. On top of this, the conquistadores were the first to expose native cultures to European diseases. Without the proper immunity from them scores died. Other atrocities included the killing of the Aztec and Incan cultures <a href="https://www.ranker.com/list/ways-conquistadors-slayed-people/thaneeconomou">in especially brutal ways</a>.</p>
      <p>The continued use of Conquistadores has touched a nerve with some in the Hispanic and Latin American communities. Anthony Salazar, the chair of the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) Latino baseball committee who resides in the Seattle area near Everett said he brought the matter up to the AquaSox when it was initially unveiled saying, “I voiced my objection to them and to Minor League Baseball, indicating that the name is an offensive term that connotes a systematic subjugation of oppression and cultural annihilation. For them to perpetuate the colonization of an indigenous population is the poster child of tone deafness. I was assured two seasons ago that the name would be changed for the 2020 campaign. They need to be on the right side of history in this matter. There’s no two ways about it.”</p>
      <p>For the campaign, clubs, not Minor League Baseball select the name. According to MiLB, the club works with the local Hispanic community and culture in its market. This includes conducting focus groups, speaking with local Hispanic organizations and community groups such as the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and vetting the name by members of the local Hispanic community. Each team also writes a brand story explaining the reasoning for its name, logo design and colors. It’s unclear if there was any push back from the Everett Hispanic community on the name.</p>
      <p>According to the AquaSox, the name “Conquistadores” was selected due to Everett's historical beginnings, and the exploration of the Pacific Northwest. The first European record of the landing on the Washington coast was completed by Spanish explorer Juan Perez.</p>
      <p>“We are using the Conquistadores name to reflect the strength that many people use to overcome challenges in life and to achieve their goals and dreams,” said Danny Tetzlaff, AquaSox General Manager. “We feel this reflects Everett and our strong community.”</p>
      <p>Team sports names have seen its fair share of controversy in recent years. The Cleveland Indians have grappled with the “Chief Wahoo” caricature, and the Washington Redskins of the NFL continue to see a backlash given what many see as racially insensitive names.</p>
      <p>And while the Everett AquaSox and Minor League Baseball certainly have good intentions, the difference between the issues with Chief Wahoo and the Washington Reds and the name Conquistadores is a matter of shifting political views on racial matters over a great deal of time. Chief Wahoo came from a Cleveland Plaindealer cartoon and the name “Redskins” came about the same year of 1932. The implementation of Conquistadores was agreed upon to be used in the past few years. Falling back on “changing times” with political views doesn’t apply with the Conquistadores name.</p>
      <p>It will remain to be seen if the name elicits strong push back locally, regionally, or nationally. But given that there are countless names that could have been selected, the fact that the name went through a vetting process, and the fact that in the matter of seconds one that may not know the history of what happened to indigenous peoples at the hands of the Spanish and Portuguese conquistadores could easily be found with a simple Google search means that Minor League Baseball, and the AquaSox should have done additional due-diligence.</p>
      <p>Copa de la Diversión has been a truly great success story for Minor League Baseball doing great work in the respective markets that partake in the initiative. According to MiLB, in 2019, teams have donated more than $400,000 in cash donations or gifts-in-kind to their local communities (a 300% YOY increase). The program clearly is a solid inclusion builder for the communities that host Minor League clubs. Everett and Minor League Baseball should put the name to rest and select a new name for 2021 to allow the focus to remain on these good works, and not on an insensitive name that can undermine it.</p>
