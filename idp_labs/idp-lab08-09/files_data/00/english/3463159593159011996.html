      <p>Losing a final in the third minute of stoppage time has to rank among the cruellest disappointments football can offer. Nevertheless, the overriding feeling in the Mexican camp after their 2-1 defeat to the host nation in the FIFA U-17 World Cup Brazil 2019 final was one of pride.</p>
      <p>Despite their frustration at having been just six minutes away from making their dreams come true, the beaten finalists held their heads high after the final whistle.</p>
      <p>“Nobody thought we’d get this far but we still reached the final,” Josue Martinez told <b>FIFA.com</b>, still wearing his sweat-laden shirt. “We lost but we’re very proud of ourselves.”</p>
      <p>The sight of tearful Mexican players slumped on the Estadio Bezerrao pitch remains raw, but they are determined to focus on the positives. “This is a group of players with a fantastic mentality, they never let their heads drop,” Martinez added.</p>

      <p>Mexico coach Marco Ruiz was unequivocal in his analysis: “The boys should be very proud of themselves because it’s not every day you finish as runners-up at a World Cup.”</p>
      <p>He was also satisfied with <i>El Tri's</i> development since their uninspiring goalless draw against Paraguay in their opening fixture.</p>
      <p>“As a result of overcoming obstacles and growing over the course of the tournament, the team kept improving,” he said. “In the end it wasn’t enough. Mexico play as a team; it’s not just about one or two players. Throughout the tournament I think the boys showed teamwork in attack and in defence, and today was no exception. We played really well.”</p>
      <p>Ruiz, a battle-hardened veteran of the game, is aware that defeats are part of the process: “This should help us keep growing and learning.”</p>
