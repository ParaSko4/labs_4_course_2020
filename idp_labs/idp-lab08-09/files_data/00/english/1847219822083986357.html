      <p>Today we celebrate the event that took place in Riga’s Second Theatre, which is now known as Latvia’s National Theatre, on 18 November 1918 – the Proclamation of the Republic of Latvia.</p>
      <p>Latvia’s greatest value is the people who gave their lives for the foundation of an independent country and its continued existence, as well as the people who now create its today and together with the new generation lay the foundation for its tomorrow.</p>
