      <h2>SaharaReporters learnt that Oluboyo will be joining the PDP from Zenith Labour Party after abandoning its fold ahead of 2020 governorship elections in the state.

      <p>Barring any last minute change of mind, Mr Lasisi Oluboyo, a former deputy governor of Ondo State, would announce his return to the Peoples Democratic Party. </p>
      <p>SaharaReporters learnt that Oluboyo will be joining the PDP from Zenith Labour Party after abandoning its fold ahead of 2020 governorship elections in the state. </p>
      <p>It was exclusively gathered that the former deputy governor had already met with the leaders of the opposition party as part of his aim to stage a return to the big stages of Ondo politics. </p>
      <p>Our correspondent gathered on Monday that Oluboyo would be returning to the party alongside an erstwhile deputy chairman of the PDP with some of their supporters.</p>
      <p>Recall that former governor, Olusegun Mimiko, had appointed Oluboyo shortly after Ali Olanusi was impeached by members of the Ondo State House of Assembly over allegations of gross misconduct. </p>
      <p>However, Oluboyo left the PDP alongside his boss shortly after the expiration of the latter's tenure as governor and joined the Labour Party before moving to the Zenith Labour Party.</p>
      <p>He was said to have romanced the All Progressives Congress during the presidential and National Assembly elections earlier this year but dropped the idea following pressure from some quarters. </p>
      <p>But a source told our correspondent that Oluboyo would officially announce his return to the PDP on Tuesday. </p>
      <p>"He (Oluboyo) has already had the change of mind of returning  to the PDP and he will be welcomed by party leaders. </p>
      <p>"I am sure that he will officially declare tomorrow (Tuesday) at the party's secretariat and he would be joined by others too.</p>
      <p>"So, we have made preparations for his return. He was formally with us before he left to join Mimiko in Zenith Labour Party where he was not too relevant. </p>
      <p>"At least, his return should be a booster for our party ahead of the 2020 governorship election in Ondo State. So, we are happy to receive him back," the source said. </p>
      <p>Confirming the defection of the  ex-deputy governor, Mr. Zadok Akintoye, spokesperson for PDP in the state, told SaharaReporters that the party was prepared to receive him and other defectors mostly from the Zenith Labour Party. </p>
      <p>Akintoye said all the defectors have shown enough interest to work with the party, arguing that the opposition party was not aware of any "game" being played by ex-governor Mimiko. </p>
      <p>He said, "We will be receiving him in the PDP today (Tuesday) alongside many of his supporters and he has promised to work with us. </p>
      <p>"In fact, there are other people who were formerly in the PDP but followed Mimiko to Labour Party and they have expressed interest in coming back to make the party stronger. </p>
      <p>"So, those we shall be receiving are coming mostly from the Zenith Labour Party and all leaders of the party are prepared to receive them."<br/> </p>
