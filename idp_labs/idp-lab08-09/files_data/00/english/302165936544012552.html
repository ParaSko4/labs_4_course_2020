      <p>TEL AVIV, Nov 18 — Lionel Messi and his Argentina teammates arrived in Israel yesterday ahead of a friendly match against Uruguay, nearly 18 months after his side cancelled a match against the Jewish state.</p>
      <p>The two South American giants will face off this evening in a match expected to pit Messi against his Barcelona strike partner Luis Suarez.</p>
      <p>A ‘live’ webcast showed the Argentina team disembarking from a flight at Ben Gurion airport near Tel Aviv and boarding a team bus on the tarmac, without speaking to cameramen.</p>
      <p>At a press conference later in a Tel Aviv hotel, coach Lionel Scaloni said that Messi would play in the match despite a punishing schedule, involving a friendly against Brazil two days before in Saudi Arabia.</p>
      <p>“Messi plays,” Scaloni told reporters in Spanish. “So you can stay calm.”</p>
      <p>He said he would decide the starting lineup at midday today after his players had rested.</p>
      <p>“They are tired, without any physical problem, but tired,” he said. “So we shall wait until tomorrow at noon.”</p>
      <p>Uruguay arrived in Israel on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Coach Oscar Tabarez said yesterday that he had been concerned about the trip after seeing images of a flareup in violence which erupted Thursday between Israel and Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip.</p>
      <p>The Israeli military said around 450 rockets were fired at its territory during the fighting and air defences intercepted dozens of them in mid-flight.</p>
      <p>A ceasefire was declared on Thursday morning but remains fragile.</p>
      <p>“I was very worried,” he told journalists. “Because from Montevideo, for example, they sent us photos of missiles that exploded in the air, and we don’t have experience in that.”</p>
      <p>Today’s match comes after the cancellation of a pre-World Cup friendly fixture between Argentina and Israel in June 2018 that came after calls for a boycott.</p>
      <p>The match had been due to be played in Jerusalem, sparking Palestinian anger and criticism of Argentina online.</p>
      <p>Israel considers Jerusalem its “indivisible” capital, while Palestinians claim the eastern part of the city — occupied by Israel in 1967 and later annexed — as the capital of their future state.</p>
      <p>The Palestinian Football Association has not complained about today’s friendly game, which is to be held in Tel Aviv.</p>
      <p>The BDS movement, which calls for a boycott of Israel over its policies towards Palestinians, condemned the fixture.</p>
      <p>Messi received a three-month international suspension for comments he made after Argentina were eliminated from the Copa America in July.</p>
      <p>He accused Conmebol, the governing body of South American football, of corruption and fixing the tournament for hosts and eventual winners Brazil.</p>
      <p>He returned to the national team on Friday, scoring the winning goal in Friday’s 1-0 victory over Brazil. — AFP</p>
