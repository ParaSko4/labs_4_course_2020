      <h1>Ant McPartlin baffles I'm A Celeb fans with brand new tattoos</h1>
      <h2>Ant McPartlin was back on tonight's show after a year off and it looks like he has a new look too</h2>

      <p>Ant McPartlin has stunned I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! viewers as he displayed several new tattoos on his arms.</p>
      <p>The telly host, 43, debuted his new inking in a rolled-up short sleeved shirt as his toned arms were almost popping out.</p>
      <p>Standing next to co-host Dec Donnelly, 44, the presenter folded his arms and gave fans a good look at his tats.</p>
      <p>Baffled fans were trying to work out if the star had always had the tattoos of an arrow and a rose which were neatly outlined on his forearms.</p>
      <p>One fan tweeted: "Am I normally really unobservant, has <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ant?src=hashtag_click">#Ant</a> always had those tattoos on his forearms? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ImACeleb?src=hashtag_click">#ImACeleb</a> ".</p>
      <p>Another puzzled fan asked: "When did <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ant?src=hashtag_click">#ant</a><a href="https://twitter.com/antanddec">@antanddec</a> get a tattoo <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/imaceleb2019?src=hashtag_click">#imaceleb2019</a> ".</p>
      <p>A third wrote: "Since when did Ant get Tattoos?!"</p>

      <p>And a fourth penned: "Genuine question <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ImACelebrityGetMeOutOfHere?src=hashtag_click">#ImACelebrityGetMeOutOfHere</a> Has Ant had new tattoos or am i blind and never noticed them?"</p>
      <p>Ant made a return to the show tonight after two years away.</p>
      <p>The star joked about his "year off" as he was reunited with Dec when cameras started rolling.</p>

      <p>However the pair couldn't resist a joke at Ant's drink-drive shame last year.</p>
      <p>Introducing the programme tonight, Dec announced: "We're back, he's back, we're all back, back back!"</p>
      <p>After a series of hilarious gags at Prince Andrew's expense, Ant said: "I'm A Celebrity 2019 can only have one winner."</p>
      <p>Dec said: "Caitlyn Jenner's agent by the sound of it."</p>
      <p>Ant added: â€œOK so two winners. Time to meet our first celeb, someone who always does the right thing, is a right laugh and is made of the right stuff. It's..."</p>
      <p>Dec interrupted by joking: "It's Kate Garraway."</p>
      <p>Ant said: "It's Ian Wright. I have had a year off, what is your excuse?"</p>
