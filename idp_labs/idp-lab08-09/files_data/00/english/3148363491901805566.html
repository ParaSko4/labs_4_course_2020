      <p>Heriberto R. Perez-Velasquez, a 31-year-old illegal alien from Guatemala, hit and killed 59-year-old Mark Knapp in Weedsport, New York, on November 10, according to the Cayuga County Sheriff’s Office. Police <a href="https://cnycentral.com/news/local/sheriff-undocumented-immigrant-drove-drunk-in-crash-that-killed-weedsport-man?fbclid=IwAR1Zihti3S97i8e54erD3IKg7u15m52yy0B--CeUG9ySPE0NoGip9X3AvHg">said</a> Knapp was driving his tractor to get it washed when Perez-Velasquez was drunk driving and hit the father of three. Knapp was a retired electrician and belonged to the local IBEW Local 43 union.</p>
      <p>Knapp, police said, was thrown from the tractor and died. Knapp <a href="https://www.whitechapelfh.com/notices/Mark-Knapp?fbclid=IwAR3t-TXkyiRXPo968HfdjM8PG6SkOqvxcNphhloScIwFxqQEx83gswcQjPI">leaves behind</a> his wife, Sharon Hildebrant, as well as their three daughters, Samantha Knapp, Kaitlynne Knapp, and Christy Stoneburg, and his grandson, Coby.</p>
      <p>Following the crash, police said the illegal alien fled the scene, but was eventually stopped by sheriff’s deputies and a pedestrian. Aside from allegedly driving drunk, Perez-Velasquez had been driving without a license and he was not authorized to be driving the car, police said.</p>
      <p>A month before the deadly hit-and-run, though, Perez-Velasquez was released by Wayne County, New York, officials and not turned over to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency after he was arrested for drunk driving.</p>
      <p>In that drunk driving case, police said Perez-Velasquez ran from officers but was eventually caught and charged.</p>
      <p>“Had Mr. Perez-Velasquez been detained by ICE after his October 2019, DUI arrest, a life might have been spared,” Acting ICE Director Matt Albence told <i>CNY Central</i>. “Sanctuary jurisdictions that do not honor detainers or allow us access to jails and prisons are shielding criminal aliens from immigration enforcement and jeopardizing the lives of law-abiding citizens.”</p>
      <p>Wayne County officials confirmed that Perez-Velasquez was not turned over to ICE due to a series of legal complications, and instead was given an order to appear in court.</p>
      <p>ICE officials confirmed that Perez-Velasquez was previously arrested by Border Patrol agents in May 2007 after illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. He was nearly immediately deported back to his native Guatemala, but returned to the U.S. at an unknown date.</p>
      <p>Perez-Velasquez is currently being held on a $50,000 bond and ICE has issued a detainer requesting that should he be released from local custody at any time that he be turned over to federal immigration officials for arrest and deportation.</p>
