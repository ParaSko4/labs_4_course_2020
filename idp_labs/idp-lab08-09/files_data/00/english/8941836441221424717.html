      <p>SMYRNA, Del. (AP) - Police are trying to identify the remains of a young girl who was found dead in Delaware.</p>
      <p>Police in Smyrna said Monday that they’ve released facial reconstruction images of what the girl may have looked like when she was alive.</p>
      <p>The girl was between the ages of 2 and 5. She was found in September near the Little Lass softball fields in Smyrna.</p>
