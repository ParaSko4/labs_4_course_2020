        <b>Frenchman Thomas Lemar was the first Atletico Madrid international to return to the team in a session without the injured, Hispano-Brazilian Diego Costa and Uruguayan Jose Maria Gimenez.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The French midfielder was involved in the work after only playing in <b>one of the two international games</b> with in the final minutes of the France-Moldova game on Thursday (2-1 to 'Les Bleus'), because in the Albania-France game (0-2) this Sunday he did not play.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/atletico-madrid/">Atletico</a> began the week with a training session in order to prepare for<b> their next match against Granada </b>at Los Carmenes, next Saturday at 18.30 in the battle of one of the great surprises of this edition of La Liga, but the team will not have Diego Costa, who is suffering from a herniated cervical disc that could even mean that he may need an operation., nor with Gimenez.</p>
      <p>The Uruguayan striker was affected by<b> a Grade 1 muscle injury in the right thigh,</b> which happened at the start of the Atletico-Bayer Leverkusen game on the 22nd October, has missed five official matches and is the last player to recover from a long-term injury for coach Diego Pablo Simeone.</p>
      <p>Both defender <b>Stefan Savic and striker </b><a href="https://es.besoccer.com/jugador/f-sequeira-j-341347%20%20%20(Joao%20Felix)">Joao Felix</a> trained with total normality and seem ready to reappear against Granada, if the coach thinks it is necessary.</p>

      <p>Croatian<b> Sime Vrsaljko</b>, who rejoined Atletico's team last week after months of recovery from his knee surgery in March, is a case in point, and continues to recover on the sidelines.</p>
      <p>Atletico have yet to<b> recover eight players,</b> of whom English Kieran Trippier is likely to be available, as England had their last match yesterday in Kosovo, and Spaniards Alvaro Morata and Saul Níguez, whose last game for Spain was against Romania, on Monday night, precisely at Wanda Metropolitano.</p>
      <p>Ghana's Thomas Partey played on Monday, Brazil's Renan Lodi and Felipe Monteiro, as well as Slovenia's Jan Oblak, will play on Tuesday, and Colombia's Santiago Arias has his last game in the early hours of Wednesday (2:00 Spanish time) against Ecuador in the United States, so the red and white squad probably won't be complete until Thursday.</p>
