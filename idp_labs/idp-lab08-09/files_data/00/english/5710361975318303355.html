      <p>
        <b>1. Housing Data on Watch</b>
      </p>

      <p>The Commerce Department will report on housing starts and building permits for October at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).</p>
      <p>Economists expect that <a href="https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/housing-starts-151">housing starts</a> increased to an annual rate of 1.320 million last month up from 1.256 million units in September.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/building-permits-25">Building permits</a> an indication of future demand, are predicted to show a decline to 1.385 million from 1.391 units in September.</p>
      <p>Clues on monetary policy will also be in focus, with a speech from New York Federal Reserve President <a href="https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/fomc-member-williams-speaks-1585">John Williams</a> that starts at 9.00AM ET (14:00 GMT).</p>

        <b>2. Kohl’s, TJX (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/tjx-co-inc">TJX</a>) Earnings Due</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kohls (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/kohls-corp">KSS</a>) reports quarterly results before the market open.</p>
      <p>The report will be scrutinized for further clues on whether the department store’s expanding relationship with Amazon (NASDAQ:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/amazon-com-inc">AMZN</a>) has continued to boost footfall and underpinned same store sales growth.</p>
      <p>Kohls is <a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/kohls-corp-earnings">expected to report</a> earnings of 86 cents a share on revenue of $4.39 billion. A year ago, Kohls reported 98 cents a share in earnings on revenue of $4.39 billion.</p>
      <p>As well as earnings and same store sales, guidance on the fourth quarter, which includes the crucial holiday season, will draw attention.</p>
      <p>TJX (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/tjx-co-inc">TJX</a>) is forecast to <a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/tjx-co-inc-earnings">report earnings</a> of 66 cents on revenue of $10.31 billion. A year ago, TJX, which operates the TJ Maxx chain, earned 63 cents on revenue of $9.83 billion.</p>
