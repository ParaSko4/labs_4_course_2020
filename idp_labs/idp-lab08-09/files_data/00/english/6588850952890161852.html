      <p>Deputy General Secretary of the ruling New Patriotic Party [NPP], Nana Obiri Boahen says voting ‘Yes’ in the upcoming referendum is a step to move Ghana forward.<br/><br/>He however noted that persons who will kick against voting ‘Yes’ do not have the nation at heart.<br/><br/><i>"Let's vote 'Yes' to move the country forward,"</i> he said in an interview with <b>NEAT FM's</b> morning show 'Ghana Montie'.<br/>The referendum has become necessary because Article 55 is an entrenched provision of the Constitution and therefore can only be amended through a referendum.</p>
      <p><b>Article 55 (3)</b> states that “<i>subject to the provisions of this article, a political party is free to participate in shaping the political will of the people, to disseminate information on political ideas, social and economic programmes of a national character and sponsor candidates for elections to any public office other than to District Assemblies or lower local government units.</i>’’<br/>Voting for the proposed amendment has been scheduled for December 17, but the NDC is against it.</p>
      <p>At a press conference last week, Chairman of the party, Samuel Ofosu Ampofo said the local government system should remain non-partisan and that individuals should contest the District Assembly and Unit Committee elections on their own merit.</p>
