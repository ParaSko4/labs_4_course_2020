      <p>JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) - Missouri officials are stepping up enforcement of laws that ban selling vaping products to minors.</p>
      <p>The move is part of a state campaign launched Monday to deter young people from vaping. Missouri’s health department so far has reported two vaping-related deaths.</p>
      <p>Alcohol and Tobacco Control agents are prioritizing inspections at stores that sell vaping products. The division’s state supervisor, Dottie Taylor, says about 83% of stores are currently checking identification cards and refusing sales to minors.</p>
      <p>State officials are also using YouTube, Instagram and Snapchat to warn teenagers about the risks of vaping.</p>

        <p>Gov. Mike Parson says it’s up to lawmakers to consider whether to restrict flavored electronic cigarettes when they return to the Capitol in January. Parson didn’t say whether he’d support such a ban when asked Monday.</p>
