      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://sportsmax.tv/index.php/studentwriters/itemlist/user/803-paulandrewalker" target="_blank">Paul-Andre Walker</a></address>
      <p>French Guiana picked up a 3-1 win over Saint Kitts and Nevis on Sunday in Group A of League B in the 2019-20 Concacaf Nations League at the Stade Municipal Dr. Edmard Lama in Cayenne, French Guiana.</p>
      <p>Tyquan Terrell opened the scoring with his first international goal to put the visitors ahead in the 11th minute.</p>
      <p>Jessy Marigard leveled things with his first goal of the tournament for French Guiana in the 19th minute, snapping a three-match goal drought in CNL for the home side.</p>
      <p>Marigard would extend the lead for the hosts with his second goal in the 28th minute and become the nationâ€™s leading scorer in CNL play.</p>
      <p>Joel Sarrucco made it a 3-1 lead for French Guiana with a header in the 76th minute.</p>
      <p>Saint Kitts and Nevis goalkeeper Julani Archibald stood out for his team with five saves on the night.</p>
      <p>With the win, French Guiana momentarily takes second place in the group. They will advance to the qualification phase for the 2021 Gold Cup if Belize fails to get a win against Grenada.</p>
      <p>The loss assures Saint Kitts and Nevis the last place in the group and relegation to League C.</p>
