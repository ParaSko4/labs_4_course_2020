      <p>Madam Brigitte Dzogbenuku, who was the Vice-Presidential Candidate of Paa Kwesi Nduom on the ticket of the Progressive People’s Party (PPP) in the 2016 elections, has accused Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta of acting godly yet discriminating against some parts of the country for ethnic or political reasons when he read the 2020 budget in Parliament.</p>
      <p>“Invoking the Father, Son and Holy Spirit in a National Budget, which deliberately cuts out parts of the country that require development for ethnic/political reasons!” She lashed out.</p>
      <p>Her comment generated a lot of support and condemnation alike which led her to delete the comment after the condemnation for her ethnic slant on it seemed to drown the support for her assertion.</p>
      <p>The budget failed to earmark any critical roads for construction in the Volta Region. This caused a lot of persons to question the motive of the government on the non-inclusion. Eventually, the Senior Minister and the Finance Minister himself eventually admit that the omission was an error.</p>
      <p>But the Minority in Parliament has insisted that the non-inclusion of the Volta Region on the critical roads list is deliberate.</p>
      <p>But National Democratic Congress (NDC) activist, Dela Coffie has accused Member of Parliament (MP) for North Tongu Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa of deliberately deceiving people that the Volta Region has been left out of government’s policy programs in the 2020 budget.</p>
      <p>“Folks like Okudzeto Ablakwa who should know better are out there behaving badly, and parroting the ‘great deception’ about ‘VOLTA REGION’ being omitted from the government’s policy programs for the coming year,” he alleged on social media in a post MyNewsGh.com sighted.</p>
