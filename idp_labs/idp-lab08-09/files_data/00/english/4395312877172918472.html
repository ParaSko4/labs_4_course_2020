      <p>Have you ever been wronged? Well, you might want to watch this story about forgiveness and the decades of scientific research behind it. </p>
      <p>It focuses on why forgiveness is so important and the impact “<i>unforgiveness</i>” can have on both mind and body. The researchers look at not only inter-personal issues of forgiveness, but as importantly, how a society that has been wronged tries to grapple with those complex issues concerning forgiveness or retribution. <br/>How does someone like Nelson Mandela —  imprisoned for 27 years by the South African white regime — emerge from prison yet forgive his captors and go on to lead a nation? How do congregants who survived a mass shooting forgive their assailant? How can trust be rebuilt…or can it? Are there different levels of forgiveness that are acceptable for being wronged? What are the health effects of unforgiveness?</p>
      <p>Most importantly, how do you “reach” forgiveness? What is the science behind understanding forgiveness? The author of the study has a very personal story and journey to tell about reaching his own sense of forgiveness for a murder committed on a close family member.</p>
      <p>The results of this unique research, funded by the Templeton World Charity Foundation, prompted the researchers to produce a REACH Forgiveness Workbook that is being distributed around the globe to help those who want to engage in the process of forgiveness and attempt to leave unforgiveness behind.</p>
