      <h1>As Tipped Walt Disney Dumps Stan</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.channelnews.com.au/author/dwr/" target="_blank">David Richards</a></address>
      <p>As exclusively tipped by ChannelNews The Walt Disney Company has finally pulled the plug on Nine Entertainment streaming service Stan ahead of the local launch of Disney+ this Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The move is no surprise with Stan now struggling to attract studio’s with speculation that they will also lose Showtime next year.</p>
      <p>The Disney tile that appeared on the home page of Stan has been removed, but some programs remain on the service, ­including two seasons of Lizzie McGuire.</p>
      <p>Marvel films and movies ­including The Lion King, Toy Story and The Incredibles have been removed from the platform, which has hosted the content since last December.</p>

      <p>Stan management have been desperate to hold on to the Disney content as research showed it was a major draw card for parents looking for acceptable content to keep their children occupied said one source.</p>
      <p>Stan has declined to comment on the removal of content and its ­future plans with Disney.</p>
      <p>Stan chief executive Mike Sneesby has said in the past that he wants to continue the partnership after the one-year deal expired next month.</p>
      <p>The removal of Disney’s content from Stan follows the ­removal of the Disney Movie channel from subscription service Foxtel earlier this month.</p>
      <p>It was replaced by new channel Foxtel Movie Kids, which ­includes films such as Shaun The Sheep and Adventures of Elmo in Grouch Land.</p>
      <p>Foxtel, which is owned by The Australian’s publisher News Corp, remains the home of Disney’s FX studio.</p>
