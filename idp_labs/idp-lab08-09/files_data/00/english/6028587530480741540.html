      <p>November is a very special month, because we get to celebrate WED, otherwise known as Women's Entrepreneurship Day, a special time set aside to observe, celebrate, embrace and discuss women entrepreneurs. When I think of WED, I also can't help but think about LinkedIn and how it has helped so many women proactively, authentically and courageously redefine themselves and their businesses. I am one of those women!As my 10-year anniversary of being an entrepreneur approaches, I think of how I felt jumping into those unknown waters. Growing up in a small New Brunswick village, becoming an entrepreneur (outside of farming and fishing) was not really talked about. From a very early age, it seemed I was destined to become a teacher: an admirable job and the right thing to do.</p>
      <p>I struggled. I listened attentively, not to my heart, but to persistent family members who figured that teaching was in my DNA and undeniably my career calling. Not even out of university, I received a call to manage two educational pilot projects with the local school board, and I accepted the offer just before my 48-hour decision period was over.</p>
      <p>I was very good at the job, and at age 22, I had a lot to be proud of, yet there was a hole I couldn't really understand or explain back then. That hole stayed with me for almost twenty years.</p>
      <p>I went on to become an English professor, the youngest at a college located just outside Montreal. I remember being frequently mistaken for one of the students â€” just one who seemed quite mature for her age. Many days, I would pick up the stack of assignments and sigh, not because of the work, but rather because of the pain I felt, knowing I could end up like some of the older professors who knew they were really destined for something else and resented every day they ended up not doing it.</p>
      <p>It took time, but finally, when I reached 40, I decided that time was of the essence and my true potential was waiting for me. I suffered through bouts of tremendous doubt as well as that evil imposter syndrome. My idea was to become a LinkedIn trainer and coach, but it seemed so far-fetched. I could see a golden opportunity staring me in the face. I decided that when fear or doubt came knocking, it would be knocked down hard. And, if opportunity came my way, it would be embraced hard.</p>
      <p>Opportunity came my way when I decided to pay a coffee forward to someone wearing a LinkedIn jacket; suddenly, I found myself having a coffee with a future mentor and someone who attentively listened as I rambled about my idea to use LinkedIn as a tool to enable women entrepreneurs to redefine themselves by having space to differentiate themselves, tell their unique stories, share their unique offerings, embrace their brands, build supportive communities, become thought leaders and grow their businesses.</p>
      <p>I remember feeling so alive as I laid out and talked about my plan.</p>
      <p>I often wonder why I didn't become an entrepreneur earlier, but then I remember that things happen for a reason. After all, it did take a few years for LinkedIn to find its wings, just as it took me time to find my voice and my calling.</p>
      <p>To me, LinkedIn represents power for women entrepreneurs: They can take risks, build supportive communities and realize that their stories are worth telling as well as being listened to. So, as we celebrate women's entrepreneurship, I also think fondly of this powerful platform we know as LinkedIn, pushing women to confidently break free from their comfort zones and helping them to shine online.</p>
      <p>There are many ways you can position yourself to shine on LinkedIn. Based on my own experience as a LinkedIn coach, here are 12 actions that can help you successfully position yourself for success:</p>
      <p><b>1. Make sure your profile is completely built.</b> It gives you credibility and allows people to get to know you.</p>
      <p><b>2. Write a catchy headline to successfully highlight your unique value proposition.</b> This space is designed to help you stand out and follows you everywhere.</p>
      <p><b>3. Become a thought leader.</b> Your posts, articles and idea-sharing will help you to build your brand and, over time, will also help you to build loyal followers and faithful go-givers. You do not have to reinvent the wheel; LinkedIn is a great place for you to recycle amazing content.</p>
      <p><b>4. Develop a confident and compelling story. </b>Strategically think of how your story will resonate with your target audience. A catchy hook will entice people to click "more."</p>
      <p><b>5. Sprinkle your profile with keywords. </b>Ask yourself, "What searchable words will help me be found?" Then take those words, and creatively tell your career story. The words will help you get found, and your story will help you get noticed.</p>
      <p><b>6. Consistently build your network.</b> Don't have much of a network? Unfortunately, that will speak for itself on a platform with a No. 1 goal of building professional relationships.</p>
      <p><b>7. Build relationships first.</b> Make sure you build relationships before sales come into play.</p>
      <p><b>8. Visuals matter. </b>Make sure you have a photo that makes you approachable and a customized background that truly helps you market your brand. The blue background means you are satisfied living the LinkedIn Default life.</p>
      <p><b>9. Get recommendations and testimonials.</b> Social recognition matters. It builds credibility and impacts decision making.</p>
      <p><b>10. Add a call to action in your story. </b>Let people know where they can go to find out more, get a freebie or access pertinent information.</p>
      <p><b>11. Create a company page. </b>This will allow you to showcase your logo and elevate your branding strategy.</p>
      <p><b>12. Show who you are behind your title and business. </b>Letting people get to know you will also allow people to find you.</p>
