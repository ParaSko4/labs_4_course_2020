      <p>Ghana recorded an important victory in Sao Tome to go top of Group C of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier.</p>
      <p>The team will return to Accra today before the Europe based players leave for their respective clubs tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Jordan Ayew's solitary strike in the second half earned Ghana all three points in Sao Tome and Principe.</p>
      <p>The Crystal Palace attacker stepped up to convert from the spot after Emmanuel Boateng was impeded by the Sao Tome goalie.</p>
      <p>The win sends Ghana top of Group C with six points and will next play Sudan in August of 2020.</p>
