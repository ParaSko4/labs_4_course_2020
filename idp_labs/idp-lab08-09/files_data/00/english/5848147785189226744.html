      <h1>Stockmarket payouts have reached a 10-year low</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:01:01+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/killian-plastow/" target="_blank">Killian Plastow</a></address>
      <p>Investors and super fund members have just endured the lowest-paying third quarter since 2010, and new data suggests dividends could keep shrinking.</p>
      <p>Two-fifths of listed Australian companies cut their payouts, resulting in a 5.5 per cent drop in the market’s dividends, according to research by global asset management firm Janus Henderson.</p>
      <p>Cumulatively, Australian stocks paid $18.7 billion for the three-month period from July to the end of September – that marks the lowest third-quarter total since 2010.</p>
      <p>“The biggest impact came from National Australia Bank, which made its first dividend cut in a decade, as higher costs and rising regulatory pressure, especially in New Zealand, meant it had to hold more capital,” the company’s investment director of global equity income, Jane Shoemake, said.</p>
      <p>“The big four Australian banks distribute a very large proportion of their profits, so their dividends are vulnerable to pressure on earnings.</p>
      <p>“Telstra made another deep cut as it <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/national/2019/10/15/telstra-chairman-reckons-nbn-will-send-firms-broke/">struggled with broadband rollout costs</a> and rising competition, while Woodside petroleum’s dividend suffered from the impact of adverse weather, lower energy prices and maintenance shutdowns.”</p>
      <p>There’s few signs of improvement on the horizon either, with many investors seemingly factoring in further dividend cuts in 2020, Ms Shoemake said.</p>
      <p>“Australia has had many years of uninterrupted economic expansion and economic forecasts for 2019 are significantly lower than in recent years, reflecting the extended nature of the country’s economic cycle.</p>
      <p>“Given lower growth backdrop, it will be harder for companies to continue to grow profits at the same rate.</p>
      <p>“Australia already has the lowest dividend cover [the ratio of earnings per share to dividends per share] in the world among the bigger economies. So if the slowing economy leads to a decline in corporate profitability, it will be bad news for income investors, highlighting the importance of taking a global investment approach.”</p>
      <h3>Stocks still attractive</h3>
      <p>While dividends are down and expected to keep sliding, their yield – a measure of a company’s annual dividend divided by its share price – is 4.4 per cent, which Ms Shoemake said “remains attractive relative to cash and bonds”.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Australia already has one of the highest-yielding dividend markets in the world.</p>
      <p>“Growth in dividends is harder when starting from such a high level because countries like the US and Japan that have much lower yields as a starting point therefore have more opportunity to exhibit stronger dividend growth,” Ms Shoemake said.</p>
      <p>But would-be investors thinking about putting their money into markets rather than a bank account need to be careful.</p>
      <p>“Equities are more volatile and should be considered in the context of an individual’s appetite for risk and within a medium-long term investment timeframe,” Ms Shoemake said.</p>
