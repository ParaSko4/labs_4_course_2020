      <h1>James&amp;#039; Clasico participation in doubt as Real Madrid confirm knee injury</h1>

      <p>Real Madrid have confirmed James Rodriguez has sustained a knee injury, which could reportedly rule him out of next month's Clasico against Barcelona.</p>
      <p>James has been brought back into the fold by Zinedine Zidane this season after spending two years on loan at Bayern Munich.</p>
      <p>The Colombia playmaker - who suffered a calf strain earlier in the campaign - has made nine appearances in all competitions, starting five times, though last featured for Zidane's side in a Champions League victory over Galatasaray on October 22.</p>
      <p>However, JamesÂ could now be set to miss up to six weeks after Madrid announced the 28-year-old has sprained a ligament in his left knee.</p>
      <p>Madrid's statement, released on the club's official website, did not place a timeframe on James' recovery, stating the midfielder would continue to be assessed.</p>
      <p>Los Blancos face rivals Barca - who currently lead LaLiga on goal difference - on December 18 in the rearranged Clasico at Camp Nou, which was postponed due to political unrest in Catalonia.</p>
