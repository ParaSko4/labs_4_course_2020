      <h1>Star Rams WR Surprisingly Inactive For Tonight’s Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:10:12+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 00:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p><b>Earlier:</b> The Los Angeles Rams just released their inactive list for tonight’s game against the Chicago Bears. Surprisingly, Robert Woods was on it.</p>
      <p>Woods was not expected to miss tonight’s game and was on the team’s injury report leading up to the game. No reason has been given for his late scratch.</p>
      <p>Wide receiver Brandin Cooks (concussion) was already ruled out prior to the game, as was tackle Rob Havenstein (knee) and defensive back Darious Williams (ankle).</p>

      <p>Woods is second on the team in receptions (45) and receiving yards (566) but has yet to catch a touchdown this season.</p>
      <p>We’ll keep you posted on the latest regarding Woods once we get more information behind his absence.</p>
      <p>The Rams and Bears are scheduled to kick off at 8:20 p.m. ET on NBC.</p>
      <p>Both teams desperately need a win to stay alive in the NFC playoff race.</p>
      <p><b>Update:</b> Woods is out for a personal matter, according to the Rams.</p>

      <p>Hopefully whatever issue Woods is dealing with, it is not serious. We should find out more in the coming days, if not by the end of the night.</p>
