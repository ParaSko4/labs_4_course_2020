      <p>The world of premium women’s handbags is about to experience an even bigger shakeup in the form of Senreve.Spotted on celebrity A-Listers like Lady Gaga, Jennifer Garner, and Anna Kendrick, <a href="https://www.senreve.com/">Senreve</a> – which is derived from the French words for “sense” and “dream” – was launched by cofounders Coral Chung and Wendy Wen in 2016, and is proving to be a major force in the fashion industry. Last week, Senreve announced that the brand raised $16.75M in Series A funding, bringing its total capital raised to more than $23M in just three years. </p>
      <p>Led by Norwest Venture Partners, this latest round of funding will help propel Senreve to an even more global scale and iconic status. And considering the Pitchbook statistic that female-founded start-up companies receive only 2.2% of the total capital invested by the U.S. venture capital firms, despite owning 38% of the businesses in the country, this is a key milestone for Senreve.</p>
      <p>“One of the things that was very important about this fundraising process for us, is that we were also seeking out a female investor to be the lead investor, as we felt that was very authentic to the brand and to the type of investor or partner that we wanted to work with. And so partnering with Sonya Brown at Norwest Venture Partners was an ideal situation,” Chung explains.</p>
      <p>Chung and Wen’s combined backgrounds in finance, consulting, retail, and tech as well as their consumer-centric perspective and ability to trust their instincts to disrupt an otherwise traditional industry, makes for a winning formula when it comes to Senreve’s success. </p>
      <p>Before delving deeper into the elevated yet approachable luxury brand, it’s key to hone in on the word “instinct” – as its origin story is the result of an epiphany that Chung experienced.</p>
      <p>While leading the retail vertical of Medallia, a top customer experience SaaS company, Chung was speaking on a CMO panel at a conference in New York City. On that day, she heard the first “whisper,” which ultimately turned out to be the idea for Senreve. Whisper number two was even more intense, as on the flight back to San Francisco, Chung felt compelled to jot down all the ideas surrounding this new brand she was about to create. She describes it as an almost “out of body” spiritual experience, in which the vision and preliminary sketch poured out of her and basically led to Senreve’s business plan. </p>
      <p>This also marked a pivotal moment for Chung, who could have stayed at the firm, which was pre-IPO, or trust her intuition and go the entrepreneurial route.</p>
      <p>She chose the latter.</p>
      <p>A graduate of Wharton with an MBA from Stanford, Chung shares that her extensive business experience had caused her to become even more analytical: “I'm a very entrepreneurial and instinctive person, but over time through business training, I had become a lot more data driven and framework-oriented, so it's interesting to actually go back to my very creative foundation and spirit with Senreve.”</p>

      <p>Since its 2016 launch, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferlee/2017/03/07/new-world-technology-meets-old-world-craftsmanship/#4fc2f31d6dc1">Senreve has made its mark</a> as an elevated yet approachable luxury brand, first and foremost on the strength of its functional designs, stylish silhouettes, and the fact that the bags are manufactured in Italy by skilled artisans and feature luxe materials like 100% genuine Italian leather. (Chung and Wen searched the globe to find the perfect manufacturer in Tuscany; the artisans constructing Senreve bags today have worked with top luxury brands for over 40 years.)</p>
      <p>It’s worth mentioning that while Chung took the unconventional path of leaving the stability of her tech career, she also chose to enter a market dominated by heritage brands that are oligopolies and juggernauts.</p>
      <p>Before launching the brand, Chung sought the advice of mentors and those in her circle that she trusted. The consensus? It was a huge risk and an impossible goal. She heard feedback like “the market is too saturated” and “why do you want to deal with physical product, it’s too challenging”?</p>
      <p>But Chung, who clearly identified a huge void in the marketplace and had yet to find the perfect handbag to suit her needs as a working woman who carries her laptop and many personal items with her, wasn’t intimidated. Quite the contrary: she was steadfast in her mission and knew that being a smaller (yet mighty) company would offer her the agility necessary to make any changes, based on customer feedback.</p>
      <p>“The original thesis for Senreve was around this idea of, why is it that women always have to be conformed into one role or another? The reality is, today’s woman is very multifaceted. She likely has to wear many hats and as a result, the products in her life should meet <i>all</i> her needs, but also meet all her wants, because ultimately, she also cares about aesthetics, emotion, and presenting herself in an elegant way,” Chung explains.</p>

      <p>The risk and leap of faith that Chung decided to take paid off in spades: this past September, the formerly strictly direct-to-consumer brand opened its flagship (and first foray into brick and mortar) in San Francisco, where Chung and Wen are based. Although Senreve’s physical presence had mostly been limited to its online boutique, it has established key partnerships with Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus (in their select top store locations), and more recently with Apple on a global scale, with a Senreve leather envelope sleeve for the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro.</p>
      <p>Chung adds: “It’s all about the idea that there’s no traditional pathway for today’s woman. The molds or boxes that women used to conform to are so antiquated, and yet people often still judge women based on all their choices.”</p>
      <p>“Non-traditional” is also a key factor in Senreve’s DNA, as everything about Senreve’s launch and brand trajectory is non-traditional while being fully intentional, from the storytelling and social media strategy, to the decision to open a flagship in San Francisco as opposed to the more obvious fashion-centric markets of New York City and Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>While Senreve’s HQ and first store is in San Francisco, it’s making its mark in Hollywood circles with fans like Priyanka Chopra, Brie Larson and Selma Blair. Senreve’s branding and designs clearly resonate with celebrities who have themselves even purchased the bags on a waitlist, as Senreve’s signature style “Maestra” is constantly sold-out.</p>

      <p>What do ladies like Chopra and Larson, Chung and Wen, and the Senreve woman, have in common? They shatter the status quo by being authentically themselves, and serve as proof that women can be both fearless and vulnerable. They can be dichotomies who blaze their own trail rather than follow the traditional path. </p>
      <p>In this sense, Chung and Wen rewrote the rules despite the risks involved: “There was no blueprint to create the brand. A lot of industry experts told us, ‘this is not the way to do it’ or ‘you can't manufacture in Italy, you're never going to get the right business model, it's going to be so expensive.’ But we knew manufacturing in Tuscany was right for the brand and we also knew that was right for the quality and the aesthetic that we wanted to achieve and so we did it anyway – and it’s worked out incredibly well.”</p>
      <p>In the same way that there’s no plug and play formula, Senreve is doing things its own way.</p>
      <p>“We're not trying to create something new by replicating something <i>exactly</i> just because it works for others, which is why a mindset of innovation is one of our brand pillars. This type of mindset is something that we've learned from the tech industry and from being part of the Stanford community – those are huge benefits of being in Silicon Valley.”</p>
      <p>Chung and Wen have honed in on Senreve’s market positioning in such a strategic way that the bags are instantly recognizable on Instagram and when toted by celebrities, even with the brand’s discreet logo. While the collections remain curated, they are now introducing new colors and materials more frequently.</p>
      <p>“It all ties back again to this idea that up until now women have been perceived in a certain way, confined by a certain framework. But in order to really break out of this pre-existing mold of handbag brands, every decision we make needs to be authentic and needs to be consistent,” Chung asserts.</p>
