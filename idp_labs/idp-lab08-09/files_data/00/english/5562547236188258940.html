      <h1>LeBron James Was ‘Just Trying to Put on a Show’ for Kobe Bryant</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slamonline.com/author/mutoni/" target="_blank">Marcel Mutoni</a></address>
      <p><a href="http://www.slamonline.com/tag/lebron-james">LeBron James</a> scored 12 of his 33 points in the game’s first nine minutes Sunday night, leading the Los Angeles Lakers to a 122-101 win against the visiting Atlanta Hawks.</p>
      <p>James finished with 12 assists and seven rebounds, and was “just trying to put on a show” for <a href="http://www.slamonline.com/tag/kobe-bryant">Kobe Bryant</a>, who sat courtside with his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna Maria “Gigi” Bryant.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.slamonline.com/tag/trae-young">Trae Young</a> paced Atlanta with 31 points, and called the Lakers “<a href="https://apnews.com/c0a5685107284dddb85df5d2cebc971a">one of the best defensive teams in the league</a>.”</p>

      <p>Per <i><a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/story/2019-11-17/lebron-james-lakers-mercy-hawks-kobe-bryant-nba-win">The LA Times</a></i>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“That’s one of the greatest players to ever play this game, take time out of his day on a Sunday,” James said.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“He’s got one of the greatest female players that’s about to come up sitting next to him in Gigi. So I’m just trying to put on a show for him and give him a reason like, ‘OK, we might come to another game.’”<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>Bryant added spice to an otherwise quotidian night for the Lakers. They beat a team they were supposed to beat at home, just like they have been for most of the season. With Sunday’s 122-101 win over the Atlanta Hawks (4-9), the Lakers improved to 11-2, their best record since the 2010-11 season.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“It’s just dope,” James said. “It’s just so surreal for me just a kid from Akron to be able to have a guy like Kobe just take time out of his day. Even at this point in my career it’s still special.”</i>
