      <p>Two governors of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Sunday paid a visit to former President <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/15/goodluck-jonathan-speaks-on-bayelsa-kogi-governorship-elections/"><u>Goodluck Jonathan</u></a></b> at his residence in Otuoke, Bayelsa State.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> reports that the governors are Abubakar Badaru of Jigawa state and Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi.</p>
      <p>Badaru, who is the chairman of the APC campaign council for the Bayelsa governorship election, and Bagudu were accompanied on the visit by Senator Ita Enang.</p>
      <p>Former First Lady, Patience Jonathan, was also on hand to receive the opposition leaders.</p>
      <p>David Lyon of the APC won the Bayelsa State Governorship Election by a landslide.</p>
      <p>Recall that <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/17/goodluck-jonathans-kinsmen-celebrate-pdps-defeat-in-bayelsa-video/"><u>Jonathanâ€™s kinsmen had celebrated openly when APC emerged victorious in Ogbia, the local government.</u></a></p>
      <p>There are reports that the former number one citizen was not in support of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Duoye Diri.</p>
