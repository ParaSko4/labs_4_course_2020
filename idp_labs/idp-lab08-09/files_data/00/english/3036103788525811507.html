      <h1>Where to find the best Black Friday 2019 deals in South Africa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/staff-writer" target="_blank">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>South African retailers are gearing up for Black Friday 2019, which is set to kick off on Friday 29 November.</p>
      <p><a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/black-friday"><b>Black Friday</b></a> is a tradition which South Africa adopted from the United States. It takes place the day after Thanksgiving and signals the start of the holiday shopping season.</p>
      <p>Black Friday is the biggest online shopping day in South Africa, and many local retailers are expected to reach record sales this year.</p>
      <p>It has become so popular in South Africa that many online retailers have invested in additional resources to ensure their websites can handle the load on the day.</p>
      <p>It is, however, not only online stores which are making the most of the Black Friday craze – brick-and-mortar stores like Checkers and Pick n Pay are getting ready for big sales.</p>
      <h3>Online payment platforms and shops ready</h3>
      <p>Last year, South African consumers spent a record R2.9 billion, and this is expected to grow by 30% this year.</p>
      <p>This growth is putting tremendous pressure on payment platforms, which have failed spectacularly in the past.</p>
      <p>On Black Friday in 2018, for example, many major payment platforms in South Africa buckled under the transaction volumes and went offline.</p>
      <p>This downtime cost many online retailers large amounts in lost sales, especially if they did not have alternative digital payment methods available.</p>
      <p>The good news is that most online retailers are better prepared this year, with multiple credit card and instant EFT payment options.</p>
      <h3>The best places to find great Black Friday 2019 deals</h3>
      <p>Here is a list of stores which will offer special deals on Black Friday 2019.</p>
