        <b>Maurizio Sarri has plenty of midfielders to choose from at Juventus and Emre Can hopes to get his chance sooner rather than later.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Emre Can has reaffirmed his frustration with the limited playing time </b>on offer at Juventus.</p>
      <p>The midfielder started a 1-1 draw at Lecce in October but has had to settle for just three further substitute appearances in Serie A.</p>
      <p>Maurizio Sarri left Can out of his squad for the Champions League, a development the 25-year-old described as "<b>extremely shocking</b>", and the Bianconeri boss is reportedly willing to let him leave in January.</p>
      <p>Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund are said to have expressed interest in recent days.</p>
      <p>"<b>I'm just an ambitious guy who always wants to compete at the highest level</b>," Can told Kicker.</p>
      <p>"But I'm also learning from this tough time when things are not going the way I was hoping. <b>I'm not playing games from the start</b>, so I'm not happy, but I will stay strong and keep working on myself. I'm often in the gym before or after training, doing extra shifts. I want to be ready. A lot can always happen in football."</p>

      <p>Can, who began his career at Bundesliga giants Bayern,Â joined Juve from Liverpool on a free transfer in 2018.</p>
      <p><b>The scarcity of first-team opportunities is not his only concern in Turin</b>, with the Germany international also exasperated over a <b>perceived lack of commitment from young footballers</b>.</p>
      <p>"They have the chance of a lifetime if they are allowed to practice with the professionals," he said.</p>
      <p>"However, some of them sometimes have a body language that almost makes me angry. I often go to these players at Juventus, talk to them, try to show them what they can do when they try hard and show themselves. But some don't understand it."</p>
