      <p>Key battles to look forward to in the two-Test series between New Zealand and England, which will also account for ICC World Test Championship points.</p>
      <h3>Tom Latham v Stuart Broad</h3>
      <p>Despite being one of the best openers in Test cricket right now, New Zealand's Tom Latham often goes under the radar. His recent numbers have been nothing short of impressive: since January 2017, he has scored 1,509 Test runs at 58.03, including five centuries and four half-centuries. </p>
      <p>However, there's one bowler who has gotten the best of him repeatedly over the last few years. Latham has been dismissed the most number of times by Broad – five times in just seven innings! The right-arm pacer dismissed him in the day/night Test at Wellington in 2018 to bring up his 400th Test wicket.</p>
      <p>Latham, who generally has a solid technique, has struggled with Broad's incoming deliveries from time to time. </p>

      <h3>Joe Root v Trent Boult</h3>
      <p>One of the most interesting battles in the series will be between Joe Root, England's highest-ranked batsman in the <a href="https://www.icc-cricket.com/rankings/mens/player-rankings/test">MRF Tyres ICC Test Player Rankings</a>, and Trent Boult, New Zealand's top-ranked bowler. Boult has dismissed Root five times in 17 innings so far, and is amongst the top five bowlers to have sent back the England skipper the most number of times in the longest format.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Root's batting average against New Zealand – 38.59 – is his second-lowest average among all Test-playing nations (16.50 v Ireland, 24.50 v Bangladesh). Boult, on the other hand, has enjoyed great success against England – three out of the four batsmen he has dismissed most in his career have been England players, and he boasts of a bowling average of 23.02 against them. </p>
      <p>Root, however, has been in decent form of late, and moving back to No.4, it would be interesting to see how he fares in the series at No.4, a position where he has scored 2,807 runs with an average of 48.40, including seven centuries, if Joe Denly is slotted into the No.3 slot.</p>

      <h3>Kane Williamson v Jofra Archer</h3>
      <p>The New Zealand skipper, who was sidelined during the five-match T20I series between the two sides, will be keen to make a solid comeback into the side. Currently No.3 on the <a href="https://www.icc-cricket.com/rankings/mens/player-rankings/test/batting">MRF Tyres ICC Test Rankings for batsmen</a>, Williamson has been one of the most consistent cricketers in the longest format of the game. The right-hander has accumulated 6,163 runs across 74 Tests at 52.22, registering 20 centuries. </p>
      <p>However, compared to his stellar Test record against other teams, Williamson has struggled to make it big against England. He averages just 36.43 – his third-lowest – and is yet to score a Test hundred against them.</p>
      <p>England, who are looking for their first series win in New Zealand since 2008, will know that Williamson's wicket will be key for them in both the games. They will thus look to unleash their fastest and most in-form bowler, Jofra Archer, at the home skipper. The England quick who has risen meteorically in international cricket since his debut this year. He was sensational in his maiden Test series in this year's Ashes. So far, he has claimed 22 wickets at 20.27, including two five-wicket hauls.</p>

      <h3>Ross Taylor v Jack Leach</h3>
      <p>Taylor, who assumes the role of an anchor in the New Zealand lineup, is usually a good player of spin. However, he has been vulnerable to left-arm spin multiple times in his career. He has lost his wicket six times to Rangana Herath.</p>
      <p>Leach, who was one of England's stand out player in the Ashes, will look to exploit that weakness. The 28-year-old, who made his international debut against New Zealand in Wellington last year, dismissed Taylor for 13 to claim his maiden Test wicket. </p>
      <p>The first Test between New Zealand and England will be played at the Bay Oval, starting on Thursday, 21 November. </p>
