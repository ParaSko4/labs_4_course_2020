        <b>Spain finished their Euro 2020 qualifying campaign with a bang as they thrashed Romania 5-0 on Monday to secure a top seeding in the draw for the finals later this month.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>With automatic qualification sealed</b> and first place guaranteed after their<b> 7-0 demolition of Malta</b> on Saturday, <b>Spain</b> indulged in another goal-fest at the <b>Wanda Metropolitano</b>, where Villarreal striker <b>Gerard Moreno scored twice</b>. </p>
      <p>Yet <b>despite 10 games unbeaten in Group F,</b> including eight wins and 31 goals scored, <b>Robert Moreno's position as coach is in doubt</b>, with reports in Spain emerging before kick-off that<b> Luis Enrique could be back in charge</b> next summer. </p>
      <p><b>Luis Enrique's resignation in June</b> thrust his assistant Moreno into the spotlight but the team's progress was never in doubt, even if a kind group offers little certainty that Spain will fare as well against stronger opposition in seven months time.</p>
      <p>Sweden had already qualified in second, while<b> Romania knew they and Norway were destined for the play-offs</b>, which perhaps contributed to a ragged display from the visitors that saw them trail by four goals at half-time. </p>
      <p>If Luis Enrique is to return,<b> he will inherit a Spain squad high on confidence but low on continuity </b>or cohesion, with several key positions and partnerships still to be established. </p>
      <p>Moreno experimented all the way through.<b> His most recent 23-man squad included players from 17 different clubs </b>and this starting line-up against Romania featured seven changes from the thumping win over Malta. </p>
      <p>Chelsea's<b> Kepa Arrizabalaga </b>and Manchester United's <b>David de Gea </b>are still scrapping to be first choice goalkeeper. The former was preferred here, while <b>Inigo Martinez </b>was the latest trialist alongside <b>Sergio Ramos in central defence. </b></p>

        <b>- Brilliant dummy -</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Fabian Ruiz of Napoli</b> came into central midfield. He, as well as <b>Santi Cazorla and Gerard</b>, perhaps furthered their claims the most. Against poor opposition, <b>Alvaro Morata </b>will have been disappointed to end a run of goals in seven consecutive matches.</p>
      <p>The assault started early. <b>Jose Gaya</b> had a header ruled out for offside in the third minute. Then after a brilliant Cazorla dummy<b>, Gaya created the opener as he nutmegged Romario Benzar</b> and Fabian applied a smart finish from close range. </p>
      <p>Kepa had to push away a <b>George Puscas shot</b> after some sloppy defending from <b>Ramos and Inigo </b>before <b>Dani Carvajal </b>was lucky not to concede a penalty for kicking through the back of <b>Florinel Coman. </b></p>
      <p>But<b> Spain put the game to bed with three goals in 12 minutes.</b></p>
      <p>Gerard headed in Cazorla's whipped cross and then poked home Gaya's delivery after Romania failed to clear. Then Morata might have scored had <b>Adrian Rus</b> not turned in Gerard's cutback for an <b>own-goal.</b></p>
      <p>Spain had chances to add a fifth in the second half, but had to wait until the<b> 91st minute when Mikel Oyarzaba</b>l, on as a substitute, twisted and drove into the corner.</p>
