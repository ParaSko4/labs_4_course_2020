      <p>“Low rates appear to be delivering some benefits - eg. improving hiring prospects.”</p>
      <p>"I remain surprised that wage growth hasn't picked up more." </p>
      <p>"If we haven't seen it (low unemployment) push up wage growth more than it has, I don't think we've achieved full employment."</p>
