      <p>Driver Hire is backing Road Safety Week (November 18th – 24th), with all its 100 nationwide offices being urged to spread the message on reducing deaths and injuries on UK roads.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.fleetnews.co.uk/tag/brake?Page=1">Brake’s </a>week-long initiative takes place yearly, with the charity wanting to reduce the 1,793 fatal accidents that were recorded by Department for Transport’s (DfT) figures to June 2017.</p>
      <p>The theme for this year’s Road Safety Week is <a href="https://www.fleetnews.co.uk/news/latest-fleet-news/2019/11/15/step-up-during-road-safety-week-says-licence-bureau">‘Step up for safe streets’,</a> with an aim to increase active mobility- walking and cycling.</p>
      <p>Chris Chidley, chief executive of Driver Hire, said: “We know the solutions are there.</p>
      <p>“We just need policy makers to step-up and prioritise safe ways to make local journeys on foot or by bike.”</p>
      <p>“Getting more people walking or on two wheels helps the environment. It reduces congestion, makes our streets safer and life easier for those who need to drive, such as the hard-pressed delivery drivers we all rely on and are frequently working to tight deadlines.</p>
      <p>“Of course, it’s important for all road-users to look out for each other, walkers, cyclists, bikers and, of course, other drivers, not just during Road Safety Week, but 365 days a year.”</p>
      <p>Staff at Driver Hire’s Bradford Head Office are being asked to complete a ‘safer streets’ survey to assess their opinions on how UK streets can be made safer for all.</p>
      <p>Dan Naylor, a pedestrian that was hit by a car on a local street, suffered a broken arm and a broken collarbone, and has urged for more to be done for safer streets.</p>
      <p>He explained: “I looked but I didn’t see the vehicle.</p>
      <p>“Afterwards I suffered from shock and it really knocked my confidence crossing roads.</p>
      <p>“I think there should be more safe crossing points for pedestrians.”</p>
      <p>He continued: “Motorists can be a bit impatient sometimes, so more bike lanes would make streets safer for cyclists.”</p>
      <p>Road Safety Week takes place on November 18-24.</p>
