        <b>Manchester City's defence is plagued by injury problems, and to compensate, the Skyblues will go for a CB in the winter market. The man chosen by Pep Guardiola is the 21-year-old Frenchman Dayot Upamecano, according to 'The Guardian'.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Although <b>John Stones </b>has returned, injury problems are still an issue for Manchester City's defence.Â In order to compensate for this situation, <b>Pep Guardiola</b> has asked the City board for a CB.</p>
      <p>According to 'The Guardian', the man that Guardiola wants at all costs is French, 21 and plays for RB Leipzig. It is <b>Dayot Upamecano</b>, recently linked with clubs such as Milan and Arsenal.</p>

      <p>Manchester City won't have problems with money. In fact, they are preparing to spend <b>115 million euros</b> in January, but 'Kicker' informs that Upamecano's price is now fixed at 60 million.</p>
      <p>Upamecano's contract ends in<b> 2021</b>, therefore RB Leipzig wouldn't look on his January sale badly, in order to avoid his value depreciating in the Summer when he only <b>has a year left on his contract</b>. The CB is on the market and Guardiola wants him at all costs.</p>
