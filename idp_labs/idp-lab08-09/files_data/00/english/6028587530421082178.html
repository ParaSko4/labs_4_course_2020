      <h1>Fed Chair Jerome Powell Is Blind To These Debt Bubble Warnings</h1>

      <p>Last week Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell testified before Congress. His theme terrifies me. The Fed boss says that he does not see any risks of asset bubbles. I look back to tech bubble of 2000 and the crash of 2008 and nothing has changed. The Fed ignored bubbles then and below are the bubbles it is ignoring now.<b>Home Prices: </b>The latest reading from the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Indices shows that its 20-City Composite rose by 2% year-over-year in August with Phoenix, Charlotte and Tampa leading the way. This index peaked in July 2006 then declined by 35.1% to a bottom set in March 2012 as the home-price bubble popped. Since then, the bubble has reinflated by 62.7% with the current reading 5.6% above the prior high. This could become a problem if the economy slows down in 2020.</p>

      <p><b>Global Government Debt: </b>Data from the International Institute of Finance reported last week that global debt rose by $7.5 trillion in the first half of 2019 to $250 trillion led by the U.S. and China. If central banks continue to print money through quantitative easing this bubble will continue to inflate until it has a catastrophic uncontrollable burst. Last week Fed Chief Powell testified that he does not see signs that any bubbles were brewing and there are no dangers posed by trillions of dollars in deficits around the globe. I predicted the problems that occurred before the crash of 2008 and the debt bubble is significantly worse today.</p>
      <p><b>Household Debt: </b>According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Center for Microeconomic Data, household debt on Main Street USA rose by 0.7% (or $92 billion) in the third quarter to $13.95 trillion. This marks the 21<sup>st</sup> consecutive quarterly rise, and inflates the Debt Bubble to $1.3 trillion above the previous peak of $12.68 trillion recorded in the third quarter of 2008, just as the Great Credit Crunch was imploding. Overall household debt is 25.1% above the trough set in the second quarter of 2013. At the end of the third quarter of 2019 the delinquency rate worsened to 4.8% of outstanding debt.</p>

        <b>Total Household Debt Balance (Trillions)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mortgage loans are the largest portion of household debt and it rose by $31 billion to $9.44 trillion above the $9.3 trillion peak in the third quarter of 2008.</p>
      <p>Student loans, held by 45 million borrowers, increased to $1.498 trillion in the third quarter; 10.9% of this debt is delinquent.</p>
      <p>Auto loans were up $159 billion in the third quarter to $1.315 trillion.</p>
      <p>Credit card debt stands at $0.88 trillion and 8.3% are in arrears with 90+ days delinquent.</p>
      <p>One thing not included in this study is medical debt. Sadly, 66% of personal bankruptcies are tied to medical issues. Among 137 million Americans struggling with medical debt, many tap their retirement accounts to pay their bills. This is a long-term problem as members of the households reach retirement age.</p>
      <p><b>The Fed Balance Sheet: </b>The Federal Reserve ended its program to unwind its balance sheet at the end of August shrinking it to $3.76 trillion, down from $4.5 trillion at its peak. This was below Fed Chair Powell’s goal of reducing the balance sheet to $3.5 trillion. Since then the balance sheet is back up to $4.05 trillion as it buys U.S. Treasury Bills. Too much money in the banking system continues to inflate global debt.</p>
