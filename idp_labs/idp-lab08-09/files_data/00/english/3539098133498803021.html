      <p>A little more than seven years after joining T-Mobile, <a href="https://www.tmonews.com/tag/john-legere/">John Legere</a> has announced that he’s leaving the company in the near future.</p>
      <p>Legere will exit his position as T-Mobile CEO on April 30, 2020. Starting May 1, 2020, <a href="https://www.tmonews.com/tag/mike-sievert/">Mike Sievert</a> will be T-Mo’s President and CEO. John Legere will remain a member of the board at T-Mobile.</p>
      <p>The T-Mobile board of directors, Legere included, has been involved in a multi-year leadership succession process and ultimately chose Sievert as the next T-Mobile CEO. Sievert joined T-Mobile in 2012 as its Chief Marketing Officer and then became Chief Operating Officer in 2015. He joined the board of directors and was named president of T-Mo in 2018.</p>
      <p>Here’s what John Legere had to say about Mike Sievert:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“I hired Mike in 2012 and I have great confidence in him. I have mentored him as he took on increasingly broad responsibilities, and he is absolutely the right choice as T-Mobile’s next CEO. Mike is well prepared to lead T-Mobile into the future. He has a deep understanding of where T-Mobile has been and where it needs to go to remain the most innovative company in the industry.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“I am extremely proud of the culture and enthusiasm we have built around challenging the status quo and our ongoing commitment to putting customers first. Together, these attributes have distinguished T-Mobile in the marketplace and on Wall Street, giving us a powerful business advantage that is instilled throughout every level of T-Mobile. I am confident it will thrive under Mike’s leadership.”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Meanwhile, Mike Sievert thanked Deutsche Telekom CEO Tim Höttges and T-Mobile’s board of directors for the opportunity to become the new T-Mo CEO and John Legere for everything he’s done for the carrier over the past 7+ years. And while he may not be as brash as Legere, Sievert pledged that T-Mobile’s “Un-carrier culture” won’t change:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“The Un-carrier culture, which all our employees live every day, will not change. T-Mobile is not just about one individual. Our company is built around an extraordinarily capable management team and thousands of talented, committed, and customer-obsessed employees.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“Going forward, my mission is to build on T-Mobile’s industry-leading reputation for empowering employees to deliver an outstanding customer experience and to position T-Mobile not only as the leading mobile carrier, but as one of the most admired companies in America.”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>As for what Legere will do after stepping down as T-Mobile CEO, he was tight-lipped about his plans but did say that he’s “not retiring.” He did touch on the <a href="https://www.tmonews.com/2019/11/t-mobile-ceo-john-legere-wework-talks/">recent</a> <a href="https://www.tmonews.com/2019/11/tmobile-john-legere-not-taking-wework-ceo-job/">rumors</a> about him becoming WeWork’s new CEO, saying that was “never having discussions” about running WeWork.</p>
      <p>T-Mobile made a couple of other executive announcements today. First up, T-Mo CFO Braxton Carter has extended his contract through July 1, 2020 to help with the transition to Mike Sievert as the new T-Mobile CEO. Additionally, T-Mobile CTO Neville Ray is being given the title of President of Technology at T-Mo.</p>
