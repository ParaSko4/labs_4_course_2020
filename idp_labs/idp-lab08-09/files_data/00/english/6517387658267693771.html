      <p>Coldplay are releasing a new album later this week, but it looks like another is already in the works.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.musicweek.com/media/read/new-edition-of-music-week-out-now/078095">Music Week</a>, Mark Mitchell, co-president of Coldplay's record label Parlophone said that the band aren't looking to wait another few years to release the follow-up to <a href="https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/coldplay-announce-tracklist-to-new-double-album-everyday-life-released-on-november-22__27594/">Everyday Life, out Friday (November 22)</a>. The group's last album A Head Full of Dreams was released in December 2015.</p>
      <p>"There's nothing set in stone, but what we can say is there's a desire to do another record to follow this up quickly," explained Mitchell.</p>

      <p>"This album came very, very quickly. They worked on tracks for the rest of the summer, so there's a lot of ideas left off this record which they're hoping to follow up as soon as possible."</p>
      <p>Will the next album be linked musically to Everyday Life? Parlophone's other co-president Nick Burgess thinks it will stand alone, adding: "I don't think they are sister records. This is very much a record that the band had to get our of their system."</p>
