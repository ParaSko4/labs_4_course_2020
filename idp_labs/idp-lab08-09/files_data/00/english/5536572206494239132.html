      <p>Nick Bosa looks like he’s on his way to becoming one of the NFL’s brightest stars. He’s on a mission to take over the league, but there are some members of the old guard who aren’t quite ready to give up their spot atop the mountain.</p>
      <p>Enter Larry Fitzgerald, who took this opportunity during today’s Niners-Cardinals game to remind the rookie pass rusher that this is a grown man’s league.</p>
