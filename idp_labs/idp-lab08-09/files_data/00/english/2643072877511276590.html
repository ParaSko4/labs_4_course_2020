      <p>The <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/17/photos-see-what-yahaya-bello-is-doing-as-inec-announces-kogi-election-results/"><u><b>Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC)</b></u></a> has declared the Kogi West Senatorial Rerun inconclusive.</p>
      <p>The senatorial election which was held on Saturday, November 16, 20019, was been contested by twenty-four candidate with the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), <b>Dino Melaye</b> and <b>Smart Adeyemi</b> of the All Progressives Congress (APC) leading as the major candidates.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> reports that the election was marred by <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/16/kogi-2019-thugs-attack-dino-melayes-polling-unit/"><u>violence and ballot box snatching</u></a>.</p>
      <p>Announcing results late on Sunday night, the returning officer of the election, Olayinde Lawal, said the margin between the two leading candidates is lesser than the cancelled votes.</p>
      <p>Lawal said while Adeyemi polled a total of 80,118 votes, <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/16/kogi-2019-election-dino-melaye-casts-his-vote/"><u><b>Dino Melaye</b></u></a> had 59,548, leaving a margin of 20,570.</p>
      <p>He said 43,127 votes were cancelled across the seven LGAs where the election held.</p>
      <p>The INEC official, therefore, declared the election inconclusive.</p>
      <p>The returning officer, who declared the election inconclusive said, he is constrained by law to declare a winner because of the lead margin between the leading candidates.</p>
      <p>Naija News reports that a supplementary election would be fixed for a later date in the affected 53 polling units where votes were cancelled.</p>
