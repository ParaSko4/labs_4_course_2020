      <p><i>By Bhavna Harchandrai<br/><br/>Exercises to strengthen and stretch your wrists, fingers, and neck and fend off health issues associated with the overuse of texting and typing </i><br/><br/>Text, tap, scroll, swipe, read, re-read, surf the net... Most of us spend hours on our smartphones, electronic gadgets and gaming devices. While these help us stay connected, informed and entertained, the excessive use of our electronic devices can lead to text-neck (hand-held electronic devices), impaired vision, arthritic changes of the thumb and even brain damage due to electromagnetic radiation – in addition to many other problems. Some practical steps can help combat these issues: like reducing phone and gaming time, taking frequent breaks, keeping the phone-screen at eye level, sending voice messages instead of text messages, and so on. These exercises can make a huge difference. <br/><br/><b>1 TEXT-NECK </b><br/>Also known as ‘anterior head syndrome’, text-neck is a new-age term used to describe repeated stress pain and injury of the neck, which has resulted from looking down and slouching forwards over a sustained period of time. Teenagers, in particular, often experience this. It’s a pity that while many teenagers spend hours working out in the gym, and may even show off their bulging biceps, their backs are slumped, abdominal muscles are weak and neck control is compromised. <br/><br/><b>Exercises: </b><br/>Core-strengthening workouts and yoga poses such as Downward facing dog , Cat-cow pose, Padahastasana, Bowpose help alleviate text-neck. <br/>Additionally follow these exercises: <br/>(a) Exaggerated nod: Sit/stand comfortably, with your shoulders relaxed, mouth closed and teeth touching. Look up to the ceiling. Open your mouth and bring the head back further. From this position, bring your lower jaw to your upper jaw closing your mouth — you should feel a stretch in the front of your neck. <br/>(b) Chin tuck: Keeping your chin parallel to the floor, draw your head and chin back. You should feel a stretch along the back of your neck. Now elongate your neck , imagining a string pulling the head upwards. Hold this position as you keep your jaw relaxed and release the chin forward again. <br/><br/><b>2 ALL THUMBS </b><br/>Designed by nature to hold, pinch, grip, our thumbs have now grown used to typing, pressing, scrolling, and navigating endlessly. This can lead to numbness, pain and tingling sensations, and a condition called ‘De Quervain’s tenosynovitis’ or ‘texting thumb’. <br/>To avoid this, it is advisable to place your phone on a mobile stand or propped up on a table and use all fingers instead of over-exerting the thumb. <br/><br/>Exercises: <br/>(a) To counteract the repetitive pressing down (flexion) of the thumb, one must push upwards (hyperextend). A good way to strengthen these muscles is to place your palm down on a flat surface, keep a light weight such as an ankle weight over the thumb, and attempt to lift it. <br/>(b) Do the opposite movement of opposition (see picture on previous page), meaning, stretch the thumb away from the little finger. You can tie an elastic/rubber band around the pinky finger and thumb to add resistance to the movement. <br/>(c) To mobilise the joints of the finger, flex (bend) and straighten (extend) the thumb fully. <br/>(d) Circle the thumb clockwise and anti-clockwise. <br/>(e) With your palms open, bend your wrist to bring your little finger towards the forearm (ulnar deviation — as in picture above); and then move it back to the starting position (radial deviation — see picture on the right) <br/>(f) Perform wall push-ups on your fingers and/or do finger planks. <br/><br/><b>3 EYE STRAIN </b><br/>Our eyes stay at a constant downward gaze as we stare at our mobile screens for extended periods of time and we often forget to blink — causing blurred vision, dry eyes, sore eyes and headaches. <br/>The blue light emitted from our devices may increase cases of macular degeneration and blindness. Furthermore, spending time on your cellphone before bed reduces melatonin production, making it harder to fall asleep and stay asleep. <br/>In order to prevent these symptoms and risk impairing your vision, you can increase the text size, reduce brightness, use lubricating eye drops, blink frequently and make <br/>it a point to look away for five to 10 seconds for every five to 10 minutes of screen time. <br/><br/><b>Exercises: </b><br/>(a) To support convergence and divergence of the eye: Hold your pointer/index finger up at a distance of one foot from the eyes. Maintain your gaze on the finger and bring your hand closer to you until it is three to four inches away from your face. Then, move it back to the starting position. <br/>(b) To support superior and inferior eye movements: Lift your arm up, keeping the pointer/index finger in a horizontal position. Keep looking at the finger, lower your arm to eye level (centre position) and lower it still, down to the chest level. Get the arm back to centre, and up again. <br/><br/><b>4 WRIST AND ELBOW PAIN </b><br/>Although the wrist is extended when we hold our mobile phones and gaming consoles, the tendons that connect to the thumb can get inflammed at the wrist causing wrist pain (carpal tunnel syndrome). The elbow can also be affected if it is continuously bent while holding the phone (cubital tunnel syndrome). To alleviate pain, follow ‘RICE’, which stands for Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation. To stabilise the affected joints, use splints and braces. If the pain is severe, it may be necessary to take anti-inflammatory drugs. Once the inflammation has gone, stretch and ease out the fingers, wrists and forearms. <br/><br/><b>Exercises: </b><br/>(a) While seated, place your elbow on a table. The palm of your hand should face away from you. Bend your fingers to get the the fingertips touching the top of your palm (small fist – see picture below), <br/>then the centre of your palm (big fist – see below). Then, open out <br/>your hand. <br/>(b) Place the back of your hand on a table/flat surface. Keeping the thumb pressed down, lift up one finger at a time. <br/>(c) Extend the arm out, palm facing forward, pull your fingers towards you using the other hand and stretch the forearm. <br/><br/><b>5 MENTAL HEALTH <br/></b><br/>Cellphone/gadget addiction, anxiety and depression are on the rise. We believe that social media will give us a boost, but comparing your life with what you see online can often leave one feeling worse. Why not go for a walk outdoors instead, or play a sport, develop a hobby, or enjoy a good meal and interact with your friends. <br/><br/>*Perform all exercises for 15 repetitions, 2-3 times daily. <br/><br/><b><i>– The writer is an internationally certified fitness instructor</i></b></p>
