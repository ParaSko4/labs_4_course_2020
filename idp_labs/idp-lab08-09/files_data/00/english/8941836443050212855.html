      <p>MORAGA, Calif. (AP) - Saint Mary’s didn’t have much defensive energy early. Once they got it going, the Gaels were hard to stop.</p>
      <p>Jordan Ford scored 21 points, Malik Fitts added 12 and No. 18 Saint Mary’s beat <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cal-poly/">Cal Poly</a> 79-48 on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>Saint Mary’s (3-1) extended its winning streak over the Mustangs to six games. They Gaels haven’t lost to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cal-poly/">Cal Poly</a> since Nov. 26, 2006.</p>
      <p>After <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cal-poly/">Cal Poly</a> (1-3) opened the game with an 8-0 run, Gaels coach Randy Bennett called a timeout and turned to his reserves.</p>
      <p>“There was a concern,” Bennett said. “I didn’t think our guys were - two of our main guys - I didn’t think Ford and Malik were dialed in where they needed to be as far concentration defensively. That’s why I called the timeout. After that, we were pretty good.”</p>

      <p>The Gaels outscored their opponent 46-13 the rest of the half.</p>
      <p>“We just started locking in on defense,” Fitts said. “The guys off the bench stepped it up and gave us a spark.”</p>
      <p>Tuukka Jaakkola scored 13 points to lead <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cal-poly/">Cal Poly</a>.</p>
      <p>Matthias Tass had six points for Saint Mary’s, all during an 31-4 run that closed out the first half in which he had two dunks.</p>

        <p>“We’re a really electrifying offensively, especially when we move the ball,” Ford said. “I think our potential is really high.”</p>
        <p>The Mustangs were facing a Top 25 opponent for the first time since Dec 29, 2015, when the they lost to No. 19 Texas A&amp;M;, 82-63. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cal-poly/">Cal Poly</a> hasn’t beat a Top 25 opponent since upsetting No. 11 UCLA 70-68 on Nov. 25, 2012.</p>
        <p>“They’re pretty good and they play hard, but I think our defense kind of broke them,” Bennett said.</p>
        <p>ON POINT</p>
        <p>Saint Mary’s redshirt sophomore guard Kristers Zoriks, a former U18 Latvian national team member who suffered two ACL injuries in as many years, scored his first six career points.</p>
        <p>BESTING THE WEST</p>
        <p>The Gaels have won 11 of their last 12 against Big West Conference opponents.</p>
        <p>PASSING FANCY</p>
        <p>Saint Mary’s had 14 assists, to improve to 3-0 in games in which they registered 10 or more and 18-0 in that department since the start of last season.</p>
        <p>FAMILY AFFAIR</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cal-poly/">Cal Poly</a> is among 13 programs featuring a head coach and son on the same team with (head coach) John and Jamal Smith, and the only team featuring a head coach’s son and nephew (Keith Smith) on the same roster.</p>
        <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cal-poly/">Cal Poly</a>: Amid a full-blown rebuild under first-year coach John Smith, to say the Mustangs weren’t quite ready for a ranked opponent would be an understatement.</p>
        <p>Saint Mary’s: The Gaels took another step forward with their second decisive victory after experiencing a 61-59 upset loss to Winthrop on Nov. 11. But whether they can meet the lofty expectations that came with having four returning starters from a team that last season went to the NCAA tournament remains an open question.</p>
        <p>UP NEXT</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cal-poly/">Cal Poly</a>: The Mustangs travel to Omaha, Nebraska, on Friday, to open the Las Vegas Invitational against Creighton. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cal-poly/">Cal Poly</a> lost to Creighton 65-51 in the only previous meeting between the two teams on Dec. 19, 1956.</p>
        <p>Saint Mary’s: Hosts Fresno State on Wednesday at Golden 1 Center in Sacramento on Wednesday in what will be the Gaels’ toughest opponent since its season opener against Wisconsin.</p>
