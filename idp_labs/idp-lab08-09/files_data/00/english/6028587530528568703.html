      <p><b>Topline:</b> Reports that President Trump was backtracking on a vaping products ban surfaced Monday, and several mentioned an <a href="https://vaportechnology.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MEMO-Battleground-Vapor-Consumers-10-25-19.pdf">October poll</a> that that multiple reports suggested helped sway the president away from actually going through with one. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The poll of 4,700 adult vape users was conducted by Trump campaign pollster McLaughlin &amp; Associates for the Vapor Technology Association (VTA), an industry trade group.</li>
        <li>65% of the overall respondents said they would be less likely to approve of Trump if he enacted a flavor ban, with the same percentage of Republicans in agreement.</li>
        <li>46% of the respondents said they preferred the Republican candidate for 2020, but 30% said they were undecided⁠—meaning those votes are up for grabs.</li>
        <li>The poll also suggests that supporting a blanket ban on flavored vaping products is a “political liability,” with 92% saying they were “much less likely” to vote for a candidate who holds that position.</li>
        <li>And 83% said they would be likely to cast their vote based on a candidate’s position on vaping, making them single-issue voters. </li>
        <li>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/health/trump-vaping-ban.html"><i>New York Times</i></a> reported that the VTA poll was read by senior members of Trump’s circle, including campaign manager Brad Parscale⁠—who reportedly already warned Trump that a flavor ban would hurt him with his base.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Crucial quote:</b> “The survey results illustrate vapor consumers are likely to become single-issue voters based on a candidate’s position on vapor products, particularly coming out to vote against candidates who support a flavor ban,” reads the poll’s introduction.</p>
      <p><b>Key background:</b> Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin were the battleground states surveyed for the VTA poll. Trump said in September his administration was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/health/trump-vaping.html">looking into</a> a ban on non-tobacco-flavored vaping products and has since said he would consider other measures, including raising the age limit for purchasing. The announcement came amid mounting cases of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2019/11/08/health-authorities-know-whats-potentially-causing-vaping-related-deaths/#68acac951bab">lung injuries</a> that have now affected <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html">more than</a> 2,100 people and caused 42 deaths, as well as fears among lawmakers and parents over the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/11/06/776397270/more-teens-than-ever-are-vaping-heres-what-we-know-about-their-habits">rising popularity</a> of flavored vaping products among teenagers. </p>
      <p><b>Tangent:</b> Also putting pressure on Trump: a <a href="https://www.atr.org/sites/default/files/assets/White%20House%20Letter%20on%20Vaping_FINAL.pdf">joint letter</a> signed by 26 conservative groups, and headed up by Republican political activist Grover Norquist, that said that a flavor ban would hurt small businesses, reconvert adult vapers back into cigarette smokers and force people to turn to the black market. </p>
