        <b>This week La Liga and the other European leagues return after the international break and Barcelona hope to have a great November and December. Valverde has some duties written down, as he reviewed the newspaper 'Marca'.</b>

        <b>Get Pique back on track</b>
      </p>
      <p>The facts speak for themselves. Last season he saw seven yellow cards and in the first few months of the competition he has already got nine. The most important thing is that there is more talk about him off the field than on it, especially in these days of the Davis Cup. </p>

        <b>Griezmann's offensive volume</b>
      </p>
      <p>Increasing Griezmann's offensive production is key, as well as improving his adaptation. There are times that you see him lost on the pitch. At this point, he has not improved from the statistics Coutinho had and this worries the fans and the board. </p>

      <p>There are players in the squad that are not having as much game time as they would have hoped due to the coach's decisions, sanctions or through injury. This is the case of Junior Firpo, Umtiti, Wague...</p>

        <b>A plan for November and December</b>
      </p>
      <p>A terrible end to the year awaits Barcelona. First they will play Leganes, then Borussia, but this will be a step towards the game with Atletico and the 'Clasico' and another clash against Inter in the next few weeks. And Valverde needs everyone to perform well.</p>

        <b>Rakitic and Dembele</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Frenchman is still under the spotlight. This season he has only played seven games. Barcelona need that fast player who is able to confuse any defense. In addition, Rakitic's final words have also gone a long way after stating that he is sad about not getting enough game time.</p>
