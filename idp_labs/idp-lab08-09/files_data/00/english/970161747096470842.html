        <b>Former <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/geordie-shore/">Geordie Shore</a> star Charlotte Crosby and boyfriend Joshua Ritchie have broken up after two years together.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The couple decided to part ways as the relationship had ‘broken down’.</p>
      <p>Charlotte, 29, announced the news on her Instagram story, posting: ‘Me and Josh have decided to part ways. Sadly the relationship seems to have broken down.</p>
      <p>‘Hoping we can still remain civil and wish him the best for the future.’</p>
      <p>Josh, however, seems to be doing alright as he has yet to comment but opted for posting clips of him and his pals clubbing instead.</p>
      <p>Charlotte only just moved to Bolton to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/13/charlotte-crosby-josh-ritchie-go-furniture-shopping-fill-new-five-bedroom-home-10735992/">move in with Josh</a> back in August.</p>
      <p>She spoke about her troubles of moving out of Newcastle to dating guru Anna Williamson during her stint on Celebs Go Dating.</p>

      <p>In October, the reality star even revealed they were happier than ever since taking the plunge.</p>
      <p>She had said: ‘We’re really happy! It’s amazing, it’s never been better, and I’m not just saying that. The love that I have for that boy is just overwhelmingly strong. It could bring us to tears, that’s how much I love him.</p>
      <p>‘How is everything so perfect? I’ve just got this overwhelming feeling, it’s better than better, you can’t even top it. I’m happier than happy, it’s euphoric!’</p>
      <p>Well, that aged badly.</p>
      <p>The two were inseparable after getting together in February 2018 but have split right before their second anniversary.</p>
