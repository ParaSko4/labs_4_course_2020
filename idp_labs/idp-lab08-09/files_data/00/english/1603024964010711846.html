      <p>Ahead of his meeting with Congress president Sonia Gandhi, NCP chief Sharad Pawar on November 18 said all the political parties seeking to stake claim in forming government in Maharashtra have to "choose their path."</p>
      <p>The statement came amidst on-going deliberations between the Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP over government formation in Maharashtra. Sena had reached out to the Congress-NCP combine for support after its alliance with the BJP collapsed.</p>
      <p>"BJP-Shiv Sena fought together, we (the NCP) and the Congress fought together. They have to choose their path and we will do our politics," he told reporters before the Winter Session of Parliament began.</p>
