      <h1>Clayton Hotels to add Cambridge property</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Caswell</a></address>
      <p>Dalata Hotel Group has announced plans to add a Cambridge property to its growing Clayton Hotels brand, with the rebranding of the existing Tamburlaine hotel.</p>
      <p>The Tamburlaine is currently marketed under the O’Callaghan Collection of hotels, and offers 155 rooms, although according to a report in the <a href="https://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/news/AN_1573837072360973100/dalata-hotel-group-acquires-operating-interest-for-cambridge-hotel.aspx"><b>morningstar.co.uk</b></a> there are plans to reconfigure the property’s layout and add an additional five rooms.</p>
      <p>Dalata has acquired the operating and leasehold interest in the hotel, and will rebrand it under the Clayton collection “in the coming months”.</p>
      <p>The luxury boutique property features a restaurant and bar, six meeting spaces and a gym.</p>

      <p>Irish-based hotel group Dalata has been steadily growing the Clayton brand in the UK, with the addition of <a href="https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2019/01/17/aldgate-property-rebrands-from-hotel-indigo-to-clayton-ahead-of-opening/"><b>a third London property in London’s Aldgate district</b></a> earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The brand now operates nine hotels across seven cities in the UK, including Birmingham, Cardiff, Leeds and Manchester.</p>
      <p>Dalata also owns the Maldron Hotels brand, which earlier this year announced plans for its first London property, <a href="https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2019/09/09/dalata-hotel-group-to-open-first-maldron-hotel-in-london/"><b>located in the capital’s Shoreditch district</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the news Dermot Crowley, deputy chief executive officer for business development and finance said:</p>
      <p>“Cambridge has been a priority target city for our Clayton brand, and I am delighted that we have secured such a high-quality, modern hotel in the centre of the city. The acquisition of the leasehold interest of this hotel is another important step in our stated strategy of expanding our Maldron and Clayton brands in key cities across the UK.”</p>
