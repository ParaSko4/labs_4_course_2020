      <p><b>(GIS)</b> —  The Caribbean Secondary Schools Drama Festival held a seminar for Saint Lucian teachers and teachers of the visiting contingent, on the UNICEF Rights of the Child in Performing Arts Education.</p>
      <p>The initiative formed part of a collaboration between the drama festival and UNICEF to commemorate World Children’s Day.</p>
      <p>Kentillia Louis, coordinator of the Caribbean Secondary Schools Drama Festival, stated that the purpose fo the seminar was discuss and formulate guidelines to enforce the rights of the child in the creative sector.</p>
      <p>Sophia Edwards-Gabriel, the Curriculum Officer for Health and Family Life, made a presentation on the UNICEF Rights of the Child in Performing Arts Education.</p>
      <p>“We are now almost at the 30th year mark since establishing the UNICEF Rights of a Child and we realize that many people are not aware of those rights. This is an ideal platform to advocate and to sensitize persons about the conventions for the Rights of a Child,” she said.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Gabriel emphasized that children have a right to express his or her views freely, and engage in cultural activities.</p>
      <p>“That in itself speaks directly to the idea that we need to engage children, we need to empower them, and we need to recognzie these rights.”</p>
      <p>The Caribbean Secondary Schools Drama Festival commenced on Nov. 3 and culminated on Nov. 9.</p>
