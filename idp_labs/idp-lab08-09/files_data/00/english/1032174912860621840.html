      <p>Little by little, <a href="https://www.broadsheet.com.au/sydney/search/the+rocks">The Rocks</a> is turning into an area not simply frequented by tourists. Earlier this year, handsome bar <a href="https://www.broadsheet.com.au/sydney/the-rocks/bars/maybe-sammy">Maybe Sammy</a> opened – and <a href="https://www.broadsheet.com.au/national/food-and-drink/article/just-only-one-australian-bar-has-made-worlds-top-50-list">became the only Australian entrant</a> on the World’s 50 Best Bars list for 2019. And last year there was Israeli diner <a href="https://www.broadsheet.com.au/sydney/food-and-drink/article/ex-nour-head-chef-brings-israeli-street-food-rocks">Tayim</a>, as well as whisky bar <a href="https://www.broadsheet.com.au/sydney/the-rocks/bars/the-doss-house">The Doss House</a>. Now, the Campbell’s Stores precinct has announced that a new premium seafood restaurant, The Catch, is coming to the pretty harbourside area in early December.</p>
      <p>Campbell’s Stores is housed in a series of sandstone warehouses dating back to the mid-19th century (and added to the heritage register in 2005), located on the water’s edge between the Park Hyatt Sydney and the Overseas Passenger Terminal. The precinct’s first eatery – fancy steakhouse 6Head – opened in May, and eventually there’ll be seven restaurants and bars in total, with the remaining five landing in the coming months. The Stores previously housed four restaurant tenants – Waterfront, Wolfies Grill, Italian Village and Imperial Peking – which have been given the option to sign on again.</p>
      <p>The Catch will have both indoor and outdoor seating, with views over Circular Quay and across to the Harbour Bridge. It’ll be headed by Damien Brassel, who has worked in top eateries in the UK (The Fat Duck, The Restaurant Marco Pierre White) and under chefs such as Gordon Ramsay and Marc Veyrat. Underpinning the menu is an ethos of simplicity, with raw seafood as the backbone. Everything will be sourced daily from local growers and hatcheries. Sustainably sourced seafood is a priority.</p>
      <p>At the diner’s raw bar expect a well-stocked oyster menu, with bivalves from suppliers such as Little Swan Bay, Camden Haven and the Macleay River. On the cooked side of things, there’s 16-spiced octopus with kumquat and Meyer lemon; Port Lincoln squid with charcoal aioli; whole barramundi and lemon sole; mussels by the half-kilo; and a contemporary take on a dish many associate with the ’70s: lobster thermidor. If seafood isn’t your game, there’s also heavily marbled Wagyu, whole-roasted duck and a chicken tagine with a ginger-lemon broth.</p>
      <p>
        <i>The Catch is slated to open in early December.</i>
