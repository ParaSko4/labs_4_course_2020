      <p>GhanaWeb has sighted some snapshots of a story with the headline “Akufo-Addo brings Jet Li to train NPP Militia in karate” making rounds on several social media platforms.</p>
      <p>With the content of the piece attributed to the former NDC Ashanti Regional Youth Organizer and communicator, Brogya Gyamfi, it was captured with a Ghanaweb template, suggesting that it was published on the website.</p>
      <p>Ghanaweb, following this, will like to dissociate itself from the said publication and bring to the fore that it was NEVER at any point published by this website.</p>
      <p>The story which has since been denied by Mr. Gyamfi with a rejoinder published on mynewsgh and referenced to www.ghanaweb.com is fake and should be treated with the contempt it deserves.</p>
