        <b>Pep Guardiola's agent, Josep María Orobitg, denied rumours about Pep's possible return to Bayern.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Although neither Manchester City nor Bayern Munich are going through their best spell</b>, it seems complicated that Pep Guardiola is going to leave City to return to the team he was at for 3 years.</p>
      <p>The manager's agent, Josep Maria Orobitg, spoke to 'Goal' and 'SPOX' about the rumours of a possible return to Germany.</p>
      <p>"<b>I was with Pep on Wednesday and everything's the same</b>. There's a big contract at City for this season and next season", he said.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>However, Orobitg didn't want to completely rule out a possible return to Munich. "<b>You never know in football</b>. Pep's good at the team and the city. No one but the press has talked to us about a return".</p>
      <p>Guardiola was with Bayern for 3 seasons, from 2013-14 to 2015-16. Since then, he has managed Manchester City, where he has won everything in England but hasn't shone on the European stage.</p>
