      <p><i>For some years, historians were unable to trace it. The 680-year-old inscription reveals the lake would have cost Rs 5 cr to construct today</i> <br/><br/>The only known inscription in Bengaluru recording the construction of a tank/lake has been rediscovered. The Ramasamudra inscription (in the upcoming Kempegowda Layout) is from 1340 CE and is recorded as Bangalore inscription No. 111 in Volume IX of the Epigraphia Carnatica compiled by BL Rice in the last decade of the 19th Century. However, it was out of sight and listed as ‘Not traceable’ when the group Inscription Stones of Bangalore (ISB) started cataloguing and restoring all the known inscriptions in the city. <br/><br/>In June 2016, Mirror had reported about an abandoned inscription on the roadside near the Sulikere lake of Ramasandra village. It turns out, this is the inscription that is recorded in Epigraphia Carnatica and one of the inscriptions that Uday Kumar PL and his ISB team were searching for. Uday later found the inscription and confirmed that this was indeed from 1340 CE. <br/><br/>What is now called Sulikere was the Ramasamudra (a very large lake was called ‘samudra’. Over ages ‘samudra’ transfored to ‘sandra’, the suffix we still find for some localities) constructed by Chenneya Nayaka a chieftain under the Hoysala kingdom. The last Hoysala ruler Veera Ballala III and the year in Vikrama era (1262) is mentioned. The six-foot tall inscription is 45 lines long and inscribed on both sides of the granite stone. The inscription header has the Hoysala emblem (not as artistic as you expect from the Hoysalas) of the legendary Sala fighting a tiger. <br/><br/><br/>“We have other inscriptions which mention lakes, but this is the only one we know of which mentions the construction of one. This makes it special,” says Uday Kumar. Chenneya Nayaka, the younger brother of Mayiuleya Nayaka and son of Kodiya Nayaka who was the ‘maha-samantadhipati’ of Veera Ballala Deva spent quite a fortune in constructing the lake. Chenneya dedicated the lake to his brother and father. The lake is not just for humans but “animals, cattle, birds and all other living beings”, says the inscription. “We used wheat flour on the inscription to read it. A herd of goats started licking it off. We felt the spirit of the inscription’s message was upheld,” Uday says. <br/><br/>Chenneya Nayaka claims to have spent 3,000 honnu (the gold coinage of Hoysalas) building the lake. Each honnu is known to be 4.0176 gm in weight. So in present value, he must have spent Rs 4,74,27,768; the 3,000 honnus weighing 12,052.8 gm. <br/><br/><br/>The inscription now stands on the side of an unpaved road leading to the lake,. On Sunday, when BM visited this spot, a fisherman in a lone coracle was trying to catch some fish in the lake, and children and young men were trying their luck with homemade fishing rods. Nobody paid attention to the inscription but it is in a much better condition than it was in three years ago. “We are trying to get the locals to help relocate it to a much safer place,” says Uday Kumar.</p>
