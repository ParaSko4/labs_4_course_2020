        <b>Emmanuel Boateng's move from Levante to Chinese Super League side Dalian Yifang has skyrocketed the Spanish club's profit for the financial year 2018/19. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The striker's sale to the Chinese side and winger Jefferson Lemar's transfer to Bournemouth saw the club yield a profit of 12.5 million euros.</p>
      <p>Emmanuel Boateng and Lerma's transfer fetched the club a whooping 41 million Euros, but after all cost were deducted the club quadruple it's profit for the year.</p>
      <p>Levante had made a profit of 3.1 million Euros in the 2017/18 season before the sale of the two players.</p>
      <p>Boateng left the La Liga side in February, and has since been a revelation for Dalian Yifang, who are 9th on the Super League table.</p>
      <p>The 23-year old is fondly remembered at Levante for his hat-trick against Barcelona, which ended their unbeaten run in the 2017/18 season.</p>
