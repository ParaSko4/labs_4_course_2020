      <h1>USD/JPY holds steady near 108.75 amid Hong Kong woes, trade hopes</h1>

      <p>The USD/JPY pair is seen treading water around 108.75 region, as a sense of caution prevails in Monday’s Asian trading amid escalating Hong Kong violence.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the US-China trade negotiations continue to remain the central focus, with mixed messages delivered by both sides last week.  The <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/news/wh-adviser-were-getting-close-to-trade-deal-with-china-risk-boosted-201911142346">US officials continue to sound optimistic</a> about a likely trade deal while shifting demands from Chinese officials have led to some trade uncertainty, as we near the Dec 15 US tariffs hike on China’s imports.</p>
      <p>On <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/news/hong-kongs-civil-unrest-only-gets-worse-university-campus-entrance-set-ablaze-after-all-night-stand-off-201911172239">the Hong Kong civil unrest</a>, the situation is extremely fluid and unstable after the protestors remain defiant and set Hong Kong’s Polytechnic University entrance ablaze after the police trapped hundreds of them in the University.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the risk-off <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/sentiment">sentiment</a> emerges as the underlying theme at the start of the week so far, with S&amp;P 500 futures down -0.15%, Treasury yields losing nearly 0.50% while the Asian equity markets trade with mild losses. The anti-risk Yen, thus, remains underpinned, keeping a break above the 109 handle (200-DMA/ round number) elusive.</p>
      <p>Further, the US dollar extends its recent bearish momentum across its main peers amid losses in the Treasury yields, in turn, weighing down on USD/JPY. Markets eagerly await some clarity on the US-China trade front and <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">FOMC</a> minutes for fresh trading impetus, as the US calendar appears light this week.</p>
