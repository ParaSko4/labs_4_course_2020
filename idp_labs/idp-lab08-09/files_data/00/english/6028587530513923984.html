      <p><i>Aviation Week</i> this weekend <a href="https://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/ge-talks-airbus-over-potential-a350neo">broke the news</a> that Airbus and General Electric are discussing possible new versions of the A350XWB twin-aisle jetliner using derivatives of GE’s GEnx turbofan. This would be a very significant development for the companies involved, and for the industry as a whole.First, putting GEnx engines on the A350XWB would be great for GE. They’re in a 50-50 battle with Rolls-Royce for the twin-aisle jetliner propulsion market (Pratt &amp; Whitney has only a marginal role in this segment), so getting on the 300-seat A350-900 would make them the unquestioned dominant twin-aisle market leader. While the GEnx might not be powerful enough for the 350-seat A350-1000 and any growth variants, if they did get on those applications GE would totally control propulsion for all aircraft larger than 300 seats.</p>
      <p>What’s good for GE is bad for Rolls-Royce. In this case, it would be very, very bad. The Trent XWB is their single biggest program, and it has just one application. If it’s displaced altogether, the company will be in a very difficult position. It abandoned the single-aisle segment when it left the International Aero Engines consortium in 2011. Their Trent 1000 has had serious and expensive problems on the Boeing 787, where it has a minority position (GE has the majority share).</p>
      <p>Worst of all, Rolls’ biggest new product development initiative is the UltraFan, which was viewed as the leading choice for any future A350XWB re-engining. If GE gets the job, UltraFan might be consigned to the great U.K. museum of aeronautical might-have-beens. Given the very difficult decade <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardaboulafia/2015/11/13/rolls-royces-long-road-to-a-difficult-week/#491953d25ef3">Rolls has had</a>, it’s hard to see how the company could escape being marginalized in the jetliner engine business if it loses the A350XWB altogether.</p>
      <p>As for Airbus and the A350XWB, the news is mixed. On the one hand, a GE engine will improve the performance of, and commercial prospects for, the A350-900, and perhaps the larger -1000, and maybe a further growth model. Customers like a choice of engines, particularly on twin aisle jets, although it isn’t clear whether this will be sole-source replacement engine or a New Engine Option (neo). Neo models have a way of quickly becoming a de-facto sole-source, as with the A320neo and A330neo.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the A350XWB is a very young platform to need a new engine. Typically, jetliners go several decades with their launch engine or engines, as with the original A320 and A330. The A350XWB entered service just five years ago, and reportedly the new variant could enter service in the second half of the 2020s, making the pre-Neo A350XWB a 12-14 year program.</p>
      <p>It’s hard to know Airbus’s motivations for this re-engining discussion. While there have been a few issues, the A350XWB’s performance has been fine. Sales have been strong too – 913 XWBs have been sold through November 1, with another 50 ordered by Emirates at the Dubai Air Show this week. This is superb for a program this young, particularly considering the difficult twin aisle market in recent years. Yet combined with the aborted plan for an A380neo (another young program), the company is telling the market that it isn’t always great when it comes to propulsion selection for its new twin aisle jets.</p>
      <p>And again, the GEnx, as currently built, doesn’t offer the power required by the larger A350-1000, let alone any future growth A350 variant. The -1000’s current Trent XWB-97 provides 97,000 lbst (take-off), while the most powerful current GEnx model provides just over 80,000 lbst (also take-off). The A350-1000 is seen by some as underpowered (the GE9X on the competing 777-8 offers 105,000 lbst), and the new engine might not help the larger A350 models at all.</p>
      <p>Finally, this possible GE-Airbus arrangement would be excellent news for the broader industry. Boeing is overwhelmingly aligned with GE on its twin aisle passenger jets (the only exception is that minority Rolls-Royce position on the 787). Airbus’s twin aisle passenger jet output, as of next year, will be 100% Rolls-Royce powered. For an industry that has always prided itself on globalization (in terms of markets and production arrangements), this increasingly regional airframe/engine alignment was very bad.</p>
      <p>In short, in a time of trade tensions and foolish tariffs and other trade barriers rising between otherwise friendly nations, an Airbus-GE A350XWB agreement would represent a badly needed example of transatlantic cooperation.</p>
