      <h1>Parentry: Household chores for kids? Work it!</h1>

      <p>Reeling from the work week and walking into a home I couldn’t recognise, it was certainly time for some damage control. Every parent knows that when “work” stuff is all in place, home stuff slides. Low. <br/><br/>I enjoyed a post I read recently that said – ‘Washing and drying clothes – one hour. Putting them away – 7 to 10 working days.’ Mine was averaging seven. I called out to my nine-year-old, “Can you put away the laundry?” <br/><br/>“I don’t know how to,” he replied, looking absolutely perplexed. <br/><br/>This is the boy who can fiddle around with most gadgets, and lick them pretty quick. By the way, that’s not quite as amazing an intelligence as many parents and grandparents think. Gadgets are designed to be so simple that even a child can fool around and figure out how they work. So there, stop <br/>gloating. <br/><br/>I suggested he pile up clothes according to the owner – Dad’s, Mum’s, yours… etc. I asked big sister to help. “Can I use my phone after we do this?” she asked, always the one to think beyond the present oppressive circumstances and look to the positive future. I agreed. <br/><br/>Back at my work table, and I was getting into the zone, contextual sounds starting to fade, only to be broken by sibling squabbling. I could hear – “Why have you left me to do this all by myself?” “Hellooooo, you’re supposed to help!” I sighed deeply. This job would have taken me four clean minutes. Now I have to contend with it taking 30, plus the internal strife. <br/><br/>Life lessons, I told myself. The next time, they will do it faster and with less drama. Soon, I can be free from putting away the laundry altogether! <br/><br/>Patience bearing good fruit, and all those promising thoughts filled my head. <br/><br/>On the one hand, though, I felt sorry for them – they were just a couple of good kids into Lego and TV shows, and trying to kill each other, sometimes. But I remembered how inept I was at everything domestic, not so long ago. My parents too saw me as a “child” and just let me be, never even drawing my attention to how things got done around the house. <br/><br/>I moved in to my own place – clueless, unconcerned and honestly – entitled. I thought that I could have it done for a price. Everything has a price, right? Maids taught me what my mother didn’t. I know now that I’d like to raise an independent child who can sustain life on his/her own terms. <br/><br/>And speaking of terms, the job appears to have been done. Ms Tween has put away her laundry and is on her phone, Mr Boy is organising his and there are just two piles left. Hmm. And now to get Mr Dad to somehow put away his (and mine). <br/><br/><br/>Over the last few weeks of my continuing life skills parenting project, I have to say that my little boy can separate whites and coloured clothes, spoon in some detergent, and start a wash in the machine. He’s actually quite interested in the settings and what each one can do. The tween isn’t half as interested and I need to pick my battles with that one, so her training is for another day. <br/><br/>My boy can also make a bed, find bowls and serve himself muesli and milk, mop up a spill (of milk, of course) and do a mean Marie Kondo fold. Of this, I will now, gloat! <br/><br/><br/>As I write this, he appears over my shoulder. “Oh wow,” he says reading about himself, “Can I get paid for all this?”</p>
