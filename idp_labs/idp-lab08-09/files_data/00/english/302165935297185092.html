      <p>TOKYO, Nov 18 — Major currencies were off to a cautious start today as market players looked to whether Washington and Beijing can soon sign off on a deal to end their trade war that has been a drag on the global economic growth.</p>
      <p>Chinese state media Xinhua said yesterday the two countries had “constructive talks” on trade in a high-level phone call on Saturday, but it gave no further details.</p>
      <p>Against the yen, the dollar was traded at ¥108.75, recovering from 108.235 touched on Thursday as rising hopes of a US-China trade deal undercut the yen.</p>
      <p>The currency faces a resistance around 109.00, where it has its 200-day moving average. A break-through there could open the way for a retest of its five-month high around 109.50 touched earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Rising risk appetite was mildly positive for the euro, which stood at US$1.10505, bouncing back from one-month low of US$1.0989 set on Thursday.</p>
      <p>That helped to push down the dollar index to 97.980, near its lowest levels since November 7.</p>
      <p>“Currencies will be driven by headlines related to the US-China trade issues. Markets are expecting some sort of answer to that soon,” said Yukio Ishizuki, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities.</p>
      <p>The “phase one” deal was originally expected to be signed on the sideline of Asian-Pacific countries’ summit scheduled last weekend before the host nation Chile cancelled the event due to domestic riots.</p>
      <p>The tariff war between the United States and China has already taken its toll on the world’s manufacturing sector.</p>
      <p>Data from the US Federal Reserve on Friday showed the US manufacturing downturn deepened in October, with output at factories tumbling 0.6%, the most since May 2018, after dropping 0.5% in September.</p>
      <p>US retail sales rebounded moderately in October but consumers did cut back on purchases of big-ticket household items like furniture and on discretionary spending.</p>
      <p>Still, hopes of a US-China deal have kept investor optimism afloat, with US stock prices hitting a record high on Friday.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, sterling was extending its slow recovery to reach its highest levels in two weeks, trading at US$1.2919, up 0.12% so far on the day.</p>
      <p>Investors will keep an eye on developments in Hong Kong, where police trapped hundreds of protesters inside a major university, sealing off roads in the area after almost two straight days of standoffs that have raised fears of a bloody showdown with both sides refusing to back down.</p>
      <p>The turmoil could hit Hong Kong share prices and could dent risk-sensitive currencies in the region, such as the Australian dollar.</p>
      <p>The Aussie traded down slightly at US$0.6815. — Reuters</p>
