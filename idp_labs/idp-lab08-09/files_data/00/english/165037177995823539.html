      <p>Speaking to 'France Football', Thiago Silva wanted to recall how his signing for PSG <b>8 seasons ago </b>was, as well as speaking about his day to day life at PSG and his possible contract renewal.</p>
      <p>"<b>My will is to continue, to make PSG a big club</b>. I think I've been involved in the club's eight years of development and I feel part of it", the Brazilian CB said.</p>
      <p>Silva also underlined his mother in making him become a professional footballer: "My mother was instrumental in achieving my dream of becoming a professional footballer".</p>

      <p>There was also time for Thiago Silva to recall a<b> curious story with Zlatan Ibrahimovic</b> when he was about to leave AC Milan: "When I signed my contract at PSG, Zlatan called me and asked me, Are you really going to PSG?"</p>
      <p>"Yes, it's done, I just signed," replied the Brazilian, to which Ibra replied: "It's not a joke, eh? if you don't sign, I don't either. <b>If you lie to me</b>, I'll take care of you (laughs)".</p>
      <p>Thiago Silva has now almost played <b>300 matches </b>for PSG, scoring 18 goals. "After eight years, with my passport in my pocket, <b>I can consider myself a Frenchman more</b>. Paris is already part of my life, it's my second home even though I was born in Rio de Janeiro".</p>
