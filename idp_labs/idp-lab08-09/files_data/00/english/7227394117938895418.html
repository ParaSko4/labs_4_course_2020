      <h1>Honor V30 renders leak with dual selfie hole-punch and no headphone jack</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/author.php3?idAuthor=30" target="_blank">Ricky</a></address>
      <p>Honor is going to announce its next flagship smartphone. The <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/honor_view_20-9468.php">Honor V20</a> (“View 20” in Western markets) was the first Honor phone with a hole-punch selfie camera and among the first smartphones to have one.</p>
      <p>We’ve seen an <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/new_honor_v30_case_render_gives_us_a_clear_look_of_the_back_design-news-40113.php">alleged case render</a> of the V30 just last week and today’s leak from <i>91Mobiles</i> shows the Honor V30 in official-looking renders. They also corroborate Honor’s <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/honor_v30_triple_camera_video_teaser-news-40076.php">recent teasers</a> of the V30.</p>
      <p>The V30 will bring dual-selfie cameras through a cutout in the display (presumably LCD). As seen in the renders, which offer the V30 from all angles, there is no longer a headphone jack – something rare for devices with the Honor brand.</p>

      <p>There is a triple camera around the back which appears to protrude from the back of the phone quite a bit and the main module is rumored to be a 60MP camera. A rear-mounted fingerprint scanner is seemingly replaced by one mounted on the right side of the phone and the phone is said to launch with 5G support for the Chinese market. We can expect to see the Kirin 990 power the Honor flagship.</p>
      <p>Honor is going to officially announce the V30 in China on November 26. Availability for Western markets is not yet known, but the handset may be called “Vera 30” outside of China.</p>
