      <h1>As Air Pollution Spikes, Indian “Bars” Sell Clean Oxygen</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Robitzski</a></address>
      <h3>Perri-air</h3>
      <p>Selling oxygen to those in need of fresh air to breathe: what was originally a recurring gag in the 1987 sci-fi “Spaceballs” is now a reality in the form of oxygen bars popping up amidst India’s air quality crisis.</p>
      <p>Bars like Oxy Pure in New Delhi offer customers 15 minutes of pure oxygen — scented if they like — through hospital-like breathing apparatuses, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/world/asia/india-pollution.html">according to <i>The New York Times</i></a>. And while the bars themselves are capitalizing on the public’s need for air, the fact that there’s a market for them at all is a troubling sign for the people who are stuck between <a href="https://futurism.com/air-pollution-two-years-off-average-life-expectancy">dangerous conditions</a> and economic exploitation.</p>
      <h3>Deep Breath</h3>
      <p>India’s government declared a state of emergency over its unhealthy air earlier this month. In New Delhi, a combination of pollution, debris from construction, and other fumes have the air so dangerous that it’s been linked to brain damage in children, per the <i>NYT</i>.</p>
      <p>Oxy Pure owner Aryavir Kumar pointed out to the <i>NYT </i>that people have gotten used to purchasing bottled water — so why not air too?</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, with the Indian government acting slowly, if at all, on dangerous levels of air pollution, <a href="https://futurism.com/self-filling-water-bottles-arrived-just-viable">privatized solutions</a> like oxygen bars may be people’s only respite for the foreseeable future.</p>
