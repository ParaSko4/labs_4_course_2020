      <p>“Acer and its distributors will be working closely with Leading Edge Computer Group to help them achieve their desired outcomes across all key activities, whether it’s for a tender, new marketing initiatives or building customised server and workstation solution for customers at our facilities here in Homebush West.”</p>
