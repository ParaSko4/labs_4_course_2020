        <b>The Atlético Madrid doctors diagnosed Diego Costa with a cervical disk herniation, but it wasn't known how long how he would be out for. According to 'AS', the striker is facing some key hours since he is expected to know at the start of the week if he will need an operation or not.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Since Atlético Madrid gave Diego Costa's medical report, the club's medics have been gathering information to determine what his treatment will be.</p>
      <p>According to 'AS', the club's medics consulted <b>specialists in Brazil </b>before having an exact assessment, since, although the club believe he will need surgery, the decision will not be made definitive until early this week.</p>
      <p>In other words, Diego Costa will know between <b>Monday and Wednesday</b> if he has to have an operation on his cervical disk herniation. If so, the striker will be out for <b>about 3 months</b>.</p>

      <p>Now the striker is waiting to see if he will have to go on the operating table to solve his discal herniation. Diego Costa could miss<b> between 15 and 20 matches for Atlético</b>.</p>
