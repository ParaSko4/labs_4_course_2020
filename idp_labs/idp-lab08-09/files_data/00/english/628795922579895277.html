        <i>Children in <a href="https://www.glenelg.vic.gov.au/">Victoria’s Glenelg Shire</a> will benefit from technology upgrades ahead of three-year-old kindergarten starting next year, with Labor Member for Western Victoria, Gayle Tierney, announcing that four early childhood services in Portland would share $10,500 in funding to purchase tablet computers through the Labor Government’s <a href="https://www.education.vic.gov.au/childhood/providers/funding/Pages/capitalprogram.aspx">Children’s Facilities Capital Program</a> (CFCP).</i>
      </h3>
      <p>The funding allocated under CFCP of late is significant in that it represents the first time that the CFCP has included funding for facilities offering Three-Year-Old Kinder from next year.</p>
      <p>Under the program, grants of up to $50,000 are available for expanding or refurbishing kindergarten facilities, while up to $1,500 is available to purchase laptop, desktop, tablet computers or televisions for use in services.</p>
      <p>Recipients as announced by Ms Tierney include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.glenelg.vic.gov.au/Jaycee_Kindergarten">Jaycee Kindergarten </a>who received $6,000</li>
        <li>$1,500 each for <a href="http://elsamacleodkindergarten.com.au/?p=1">Elsa Macleod Kindergarten</a>, <a href="https://www.glenelg.vic.gov.au/Karreeta_Peeneeyt_Mara_Portland_Child_and_Family_Complex">Karreeta Peeneeyt Mara Portland Child &amp; Family Complex</a> and <a href="https://www.goodstart.org.au/centres/portland/contact">Goodstart Early Learning Portland</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Victoria will roll out <a href="https://www.education.vic.gov.au/about/programs/Pages/three-year-old-kinder.aspx">Three-Year-Old Kindergarten in 2020</a> in six regional local government areas, with the program to be progressively rolled out across the state in the following years.</p>
      <p>By 2022, the Three-Year-Old Kindergarten program will roll out statewide, with children to have access to at least five hours of kindergarten per week.</p>
      <p>Ms Tierney said she was “delighted” that Portland kindergartens will receive funding to upgrade their IT equipment.</p>
