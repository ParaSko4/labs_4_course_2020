      <p>Melbourne has long been heralded as the cultural capital of Australia, a claim that rings especially true when it comes to electronic music. These days, the city boasts a deep pool of artists, dozens of hardworking promoters and (generally) supportive local authorities. In recent years, Local DJs, producers and record labels have forged a new musical identity that's comfortable in its own skin. "I remember a time, not that long ago, where we used to fantasise about the scenes in Berlin and London," says Mic Newman, AKA Fantastic Man. "It's been great to see the whole situation flip to where it's almost like the supply can't keep up with the demand." <br/><br/>But the city faces some challenges, too. A decade-long freeze on new late-night liquor licenses in inner Melbourne has meant the loss of key music venues hasn't been offset with new openings, putting pressure on the club scene to do more with less. And Australia's isolation from the rest of the world means that some artists still feel compelled to move to Europe to further their careers. Following our recent <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/features/3556">Sydney</a> documentary, RA's latest Real Scenes film takes stock of a city whose dance music community has earned global attention.</p>
