        <b>Ivory Coast will be missing the services of captain Ibrahim Sangare in the game against Ghana in the semi-finals of the U23 Africa Cup of Nations.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Young Elephants take on the Black Meteors at the Cairo International Stadium on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The midfielder has been recalled by his French club Toulouse FC even though the tournament is not over.</p>
      <p>Sangare was only released for the international break period leaving him with no option than to depart the Ivorian camp.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old will leave Egypt on Monday for France to resume training with his club.</p>
      <p>Souahilo Haidara's side will also be missing striker Christian Kouame who has suffered a cruciate ligament rupture, ruling him out for the rest of the season.</p>
      <p>A win for either side in the game will see them automatically book a place for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.</p>
