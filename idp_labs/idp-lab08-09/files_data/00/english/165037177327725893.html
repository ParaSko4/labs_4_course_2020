      <h1>Luis Enrique could return to coach Spain for the Euro's</h1>

        <b>Robert Moreno's future as Spain coach has not been very clear in the last few days and Luis Enrique is on the cards as a possible replacement, after having left the post due to the death of his daughter.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Juanma Castano, director of 'El Partidazo de COPE', stated that <b>Robert Moreno will not be the Spanish coach in the Euro 2020 </b>and that <b>Luis Enrique is the favorite</b> to lead Spain in it. Minutes later, they said on the same station that this Tuesday there is<b> a meeting scheduled between Luis Rubiales</b>, president of the Federation, and <b>Robert Moreno. </b></p>
      <p>The Asturian technician took charge of Spain after the World Cup, but had to leave his post due to the illness and subsequent death of his daughter Xana. His assistant<b> Robert Moreno stepped forward last June</b> and got Spain into the Euro's.</p>
      <p>With Spain guaranteed a place in the Euro's, Luis Rubiales, <b>has contacted Luis Enrique</b>. The ex-coach of Barcelona, Celta and Roma would be willing to take charge of the national team again.</p>
      <p>Although in the Federation there is<b> satisfaction with Robert's work, he has not been offered a contract renewal </b>and Luis Rubiales did not want to repeat a case like that of Julen Lopetegui. The sports management, at the same time, was always <b>open to the return of Luis Enrique,</b> an option that Juanma Castano said could be imminent once the qualifying phase for the UEFA EURO is over.</p>
      <p>The director of 'El Partidazo de COPE' insisted, however, that <b>Robert Moreno will not be the coach of the national team</b> at the next European Championship. <b>Marcelino García Toral and Ernesto Valverde </b>are other names of possible candidates that have arose. </p>

      <p>It remains to be seen <b>if Robert Moreno would accept to stay with Luis Enrique </b>or another coach as the assistant he already was. The Catalan coach would not have taken too well the idea of not directing Spain in the Euro.</p>
      <p>Luis Enrique has also been<b> rumoured to manage Arsenal in recent weeks,</b> although his return to the national team does seem a plausible possibility.</p>
