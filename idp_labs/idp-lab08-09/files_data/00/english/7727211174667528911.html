      <p>The mother-of-two, who lives in a five-bedroom home with her husband Mark, 54, said the win allowed her to "indulge" in her "passion" for singer Robbie Williams.</p>

      <p>She moved from a four-bedroom home to a five-bed and swapped her eight-year-old Ford Focus for a Bentley.</p>

      <p>On breaking the news to his boss, Mr Wragg said: "When I told him I'd had a win, he said: 'That reminds me, I need to check my ticket.' I said 'don't bother Dave - I won the lot'."</p>

      <p>He said: "When we saw three giant white stretch limos waiting for us outside the airport, it was an incredible moment. I felt 10ft tall."</p>

      <p>He said: "I needed an emergency quadruple bypass and instead of waiting our daughter researched the top surgeon and I paid to go private - so the lottery has kept me healthy as well as happy."</p>
      <h3>2010 - Susan Herdman, from Boroughbridge, North Yorkshire</h3>
      <p>Susan said she could barely afford her heating bills before she won £1,182,714 on January 16 2010.</p>

      <p>"I picked up a magazine in the salon and read a story about a woman who'd had a perfect life and suddenly died," she said.</p>
      <p>"It was a light bulb moment. I sold my salon two days later and never looked back. "</p>
      <p>She said she turned her focus to autograss racing, eventually winning a national championship in 2016 and 2017.</p>

      <p>With two autistic children, the 40-year-old, who was on benefits, said she purchased a house "five minutes up the road" so her children could be closer to the school they attend.</p>
