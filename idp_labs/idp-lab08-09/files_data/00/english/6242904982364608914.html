        <b>Asante Kotoko will from Monday, 18 November, 2019 begin a five-day justify-your-inclusion exercise for players under 18 years. </b>
      </p>
      <p>This is to revive the club's youth team which was disbanded in 2018 by Executive Chairman Dr Kwame Kyei.</p>
      <p>Also, the club want to meet Confederation of African Football's (CAF) Club Licensing Regulations which require that, clubs have a youth system of both U15 and U19 teams.</p>
      <p>Kotoko assistant coach Akakpo Patron-formerly of WAFA SC-will supervise the exercise which will take place at the Adako Jachie Training Ground.</p>
      <p>The club's Public Relations Officer, Kennedy Boakye-Ansah told Kotoko Express App: "We are re-establishing the Youth Team and are starting with a justify-your-inclusion exercise for talented players below that age limit on Monday.</p>
      <p>"Management knows the relevance of the youth system and the impact it has had on the team in the early 2000's and even in the 80’s.</p>
      <p>''It is necessary, therefore, that we re-introduce it as part of our measures to steer the team in a new direction.</p>
      <p>''We hope to unearth as many talents as possible, who will form part of the future generation of Kotoko.''</p>
