      <p>There are so many ways that couples run into trouble. How can there be common patterns connecting them all? Research on couple relationships confirms that there are classic patterns connecting them all.</p>
      <p>Here are nine things common to all couple problems:</p>
      <p><b>All Couple Problems are Vicious Cycles:</b> All approaches to couple distress view couple problems as vicious cycles. Wile (2013) reflects on various authors who explain these cycles using the terms, pursuit and distance, demanding-withdrawn, and rejection-intrusion among other terms. He explains these classic patterns by stating “one partner seeks connection (time together, intimate talk, affection, romance, or <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/sex">sex</a>) and the other seeks separation (time alone, independent activity). The result is a vicious cycle. Pursuing partners feel increasingly abandoned and intensify their connection-seeking whereas distancing partners feel increasingly invalidated and intensify their separation-seeking. Each partner’s solution exacerbates the other’s problem” (p. 19).</p>
      <p><b>Emotional Bank Accounts:</b> By far the most influential research clinician on couple relationships is <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/the-gottman-method">John Gottman</a>. Gottman (1999) has said, “There are three types of stable, happy couples, not just one. These three types—volatile, validating, and conflict avoiding—have very different attributes, yet they are similar in that they all have a 5 to 1 ratio of positive-to-negative exchanges. This ratio suggests that there is something like an ‘emotional bank account’ that is operating to make these marriages very rich climates of positivity, yet very different rich climates” (p.88, emphasis in original). Distressed couples often share overdrawn emotional bank accounts or many more negative exchanges than positive.</p>
      <p><b>Dow-Jones Ratios: </b>One prominent factor alluded to in the quote above on the 5 to 1 ratio of positives to negatives in happy stable couples, is what Gottman has termed the “Dow-Jones” Ratios. Therefore, the more baseline negativity in couples’ interactions the more likely they are to split. The greater the positive ratio, the more positive is their prospect of satisfaction.</p>
      <p><b>Harsh Start-Ups: </b>The first factor, after the ratio of positives to negatives, that predicted divorce turned out to be what Gottman termed harsh start-ups. It turned out that the way partners introduce a topic of disagreement is critically important in predicting marital outcomes. Harsh start-ups (quick escalations from neutral to negative affect), particularly by the wife, were found to be highly associated with marital distress and divorce. Harsh starts predicted harsh endings.</p>
      <p><b>The Four Horsemen: </b>Furthermore, Gottman's group found in counting negatives that not all negatives were equal. Four behaviors emerged, which they eventually termed “The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse”. These four, found to be the most corrosive, were <i>criticism</i>, <i>contempt, defensiveness</i>, and <i>stonewalling</i>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><i><b>Criticism </b></i>implies that there is something globally wrong with one’s partner (“You always”, You never,” “What is wrong with you?” “Why are you so…” and so on). As can be seen, a healthy dose of toxic blame is imbedded within criticism, which can also include sarcasm.</li>
        <li>The second horseman is <i><b>defensiveness</b></i>. Defensiveness is a common response to criticism. It usually includes denying responsibility for the problem, implying that the other partner is at fault, fueling further escalation.</li>
        <li>The third horseman, <i><b>contempt</b></i>, turns out to be one of the deadliest in that it appeared in most couples who eventually <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/divorce">divorced</a>. Gottman defined Contempt as any statement or nonverbal behavior that puts oneself on a higher plane than one’s partner. It includes a universal facial expression combining pulling the corner of the lip to the side, rolling the eyes and looking up. Mockery, especially in public, is a particularly harmful example, as is correcting one’s partner’s grammar during a fight. Contempt is the single best predictor of divorce to the extent that happy marriages’ arguments included essentially no contempt.</li>
        <li>The final horseman is <i><b>stonewalling</b></i>. Gottman defined Stonewalling as any way in which one partner withdraws from interaction with the other. It occurs most often in men (85% in several of the group’s studies). In fact, when stonewalling was found in women, it became highly predictive of divorce.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Flooding</b>: Flooding refers to the experience of being so overwhelmed with a sudden barrage of negativity from one’s spouse that one shuts down and withdraws as a form of defense, leading to the phenomenon of stonewalling. In true vicious cycle form, however, one’s partner may meet such withdrawal with frustration, and a new round of demands may then emerge for the other to engage.</p>
      <p><b>Failed Repair Attempts:</b> Gottman has suggested that the one greatest savior of all marriages is the ability to successfully repair potential damage during and after arguments. They define a repair attempt as anything done by one or another partner that attempts to prevent negativity from escalating out of control in their disagreements. Repairs may consist of a comment on the communication itself, or deferring to the other’s position, or expressing appreciation for the partner, or softening the complaint, or even including <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/laughter">laughing</a> about the argument as an example of how silly they can get, and so on.</p>
      <p>As noted earlier, in the three different yet successful types of marriages, their greatest strength was not that they didn’t argue. It was that the partners were ready willing and able to accept each other’s attempts at repairing their relationship during and after these quarrels.</p>
      <p>However, it is not simply that attempts to repair do not occur in distressed couples and that this is the problem. Repair attempts occur even in the most distressed relationships. What makes a difference is whether the attempt to repair is successfully allowed and received.</p>
      <p><b>Perpetual Problems: </b>The remaining critical factor in distinguishing successful from distressed relationships is a couple’s ability to distinguish between solvable and unsolvable problems. Perpetual arguments about unsolvable problems are, above all, one of the greatest core problems to be resolved in helping distressed marriages. The Gottman group found that about 69% of couple arguments were about essentially irresolvable differences and had been going on for years. Perpetual problems tend to be based on incompatibilities, vulnerabilities, and both parties becoming polarized and entrenched in their position. The pattern of the problem thus becomes self-perpetuating and cause for hurt, mistrust, and alienation in itself. It becomes an example of what is wrong with the <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/marriage">marriage</a>.</p>
      <p><b>Downward Spirals Toward Divorce:</b> Emotional disengagement tends to be the eventual result of these cascading cycles on negative interactions. This is characterized as the absence of positive affect, partners leading parallel lives, little <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/friends">friendship</a>, unacknowledged tension with little soothing by either partner for the other.</p>
      <p>Combining these and other related factors, Gottman and his colleagues have been able to predict divorce with 96% accuracy. These successive factors include: harsh start-ups to disagreements, presence of the four horsemen, flooding (becoming emotionally overwhelmed), <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/body-language">body language</a> and cues of physiological discomfort, failed repair attempts, and pervasive negativity (bad attributions and memories).</p>
      <p><b>Breaking the Cycle: </b>So, breaking these common problem patterns involves helping couples disengage from perpetual arguments over unsolvable problems, developing a dialogue around them, identifying solvable problems, building more positive perceptions of each other to allow for more positive interchanges, and ultimately to help the partners accept repair attempts from each other as they move forward in their relationship. In other words, couples need to reduce the triggers for problems while going toward their inevitable arguments in new ways. Inevitably, breaking these vicious cycles is the task of effective couple <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/therapy">therapy</a>—the focus of my next post.</p>
