      <h1>Harry Styles Reportedly Shades Ex-One Direction Member Zayn Malik During SNL Performance</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:08:18+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 00:08</time> by <a rel="author">Bridget Hill</a></address>
      <p>According to a report from Vanity Fair, during Harry Styles’ appearence on<i> Saturday Night Live</i> last night, the star was there as not only a host but also as a musical guest. Reportedly, he is the 33rd artist to act as host and performer, joining a long list of other artists including Garth Brooks, Taylor Swift, Willie Nelson, and others.</p>
      <p>As part of his opening speech, Harry, who was playing the piano at the same time, stated that he was no longer in a “boy band,” but in a “man band.” Although, he did shout out to One Direction and stated that he “loved those guys.”</p>
      <p>Harry added they were all his brothers, naming each other member aloud until he finally got to the fourth, and said “Ringo!” instead. When Harry made the joke, everyone in the crowd “wooed” at him. As a consequence of the joke, many people online took it very seriously, with some people joining Zayn’s team and others for Harry.</p>
      <p>Some people online accused Harry of lacking gratitude and also having a “bat symbol” for a hairstyle. You can check out one such post below:</p>

      <p>As fans of the band know, the supposed chasm between members of One Direction began when Zayn Malik left in 2015. For the most part, Harry has stayed out of the conflict – at least in the public’s eye – however, last night, he chose to enter it.</p>
      <p>Ironically, the joke was kind of a misfire in the sense that it was actually Paul McCartney who left The Beatles first, rather than Ringo Starr. Additionally, musical historians say that everyone in the band actually liked Mr. Starr.</p>
      <p>For instance, Ringo appeared on all of their solo albums, including George Harrison’s <i>All Things Must Pass</i>, as well as <i>Plastic Ono Band</i> from John and Yoko. Paul McCartney made an appearence on Ringo’s album as well, <i>Sentimental Journey.</i></p>
      <p>Furthermore, Vanity Fair reports, Ringo even engaged in a session for Yoko Ono’s record, <i>Fly.</i> Whether or not Harry’s musical history is on point, people on social media took his comments to heart.</p>
