      <p>DENVER (AP) - The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/colorado-supreme-court/">Colorado Supreme Court</a> has ruled people may use medical marijuana while serving probation.</p>
      <p>KMGH-TV reports the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/colorado-supreme-court/">state’s highest court</a> issued the ruling Monday.</p>
      <p>The justices approved an exception for prosecutors to show evidence that using the drug would run counter to achieving the probation goals in individual cases.</p>
      <p>Records say the case stemmed from a lower court decision to prevent a woman who pleaded guilty to DUI from using medical marijuana during her 12 months of unsupervised probation.</p>
      <p>The woman held a valid medical marijuana card.</p>

      <p>A county court blocked her use because a medical professional did not testify about her need for it.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/colorado-supreme-court/">Supreme Court</a> ruling says the language of the medical marijuana statute creates a presumption the drug can be used while on probation.</p>
