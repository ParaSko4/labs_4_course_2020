      <h1>Days Gone 2 is Looking Very Likely at This Point</h1>

      <p>Sony Bend Studio recently took home the trophy for the PlayStation Game of the Year at the Golden Joystick 2019 awards and although not everyone loved the game, it has done exceptionally well and the developer continued to push out free updates after the game’s release in April this year. Now, it looks more likely than ever that Days Gone 2 will happen and could even be in the early stages of development, likely for the PS5.</p>

      <p>Last month, it was spotted by <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/days-gone-developer-pre-production-next-game/">Dualshockers</a> that Sony Bend Studio lighting lead, Jeremy Vickery, updated his LinkedIn profile to state that he is “now involved in the pre-production planning for our next title”. The next title could, of course, be a completely different game, but at the Golden Joystick 2019 awards speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/days-gone-2-sequel-tease/">GamesRadar</a>, Chris Reese, the director of Sony Bend Studio, teased that the developer isn’t done with the post-apocalyptic world filled with Freakers.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the original and the IP, Chris Reese reportedly said that:</p>
      <blockquote>Oh yeah, it is certainly a passion of ours, and that’s what we’ve always wanted to do. This is a world that we want to keep breathing more life into and explore many, many different avenues. So who knows, we’ll see!</blockquote>
      <p>Further, Chris talked about how awesome it was to receive such great recognition from the gaming community:</p>
      <blockquote>It’s awesome, because there was so much dedication and hard work from the team, and this is kind of the final payoff for that. To see the players actually engage with the game and really enjoy the passion that we put into it, to see that come back, it’s awe-inspiring.</blockquote>
      <p>It is clear that Sony Bend Studio wants to continue with the world of Days Gone and since the game did so well, it is very, very likely that we will see Days Gone 2 sometime in the future. However, no official announcement has been made and since the PS5 releases in Holiday 2020 and the game could only be in a pre-production and planning phase right now.</p>
