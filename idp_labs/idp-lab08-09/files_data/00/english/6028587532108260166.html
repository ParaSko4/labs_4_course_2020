      <p>“We have a long standing, strong and trustful relationship with Boeing and thus we decided to turn our option into an order. We stand behind our strategic decision to phase the 737 MAX into our fleet for all of its economic and ecological advantages, mid- and long-term,” says Jens Bischof, CEO of SunExpress. “We have full confidence that Boeing will deliver us a safe, reliable, and efficient aircraft. However, it goes without saying that this requires the undisputed airworthiness of the model, granted by all relevant authorities. Our utmost priority at SunExpress is and has always been safety.”</p>
      <p>SunExpress is a joint venture between Lufthansa and Turkish Airlines and has been operating flights to popular holiday destinations in the Mediterranean, Black Sea, North Africa and the Red Sea since 1989. The airline currently operates up to 1,800 flights a week on a fleet of 84 aircraft, including the Boeing 737-800 and Airbus A330.</p>
      <p>Stan Deal, president &amp; CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes addressed the impact of the 737MAX grounding during the order signing ceremony expressing regret for the impact this delay has had on SunExpress. “The Boeing team is working hard to safely return the airplane to service and providing the capacity for SunExpress to continue serving as the backbone of air travel in the Turkish tourism industry,” he said.</p>
