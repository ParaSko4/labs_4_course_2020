      <p>The UK’s top 100 restaurants swung to a loss this year as they struggled to stay afloat under the increasing pressure of rising overheads and falling sales, which are taking their toll on the casual dining sector. </p>
      <p>The industry has plunged to a £93m loss in the last 12 months, in a year that has seen the collapse of casual dining veteran Jamie’s Italian, while Frankie &amp; Benny’s, Chiquito, Giraffe and Ed’s Easy Diner faced branch closures.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Last year the top 100 restaurants in the UK reported profit of £37m, according to research by accountancy firm UHY Hacker Young, which has analysed data from company’s latest publicly available financial accounts. </p>
      <p>However, a slump in consumer spending – the average household now spends £967.20 per year on dining out compared to £988 last year- and mounting costs such as wages, rents and raw materials are weighing on restaurants’ profitability. </p>
      <p>In London, Flat Iron was forced to close its Notting Hill restaurant in July after a hike in rent prices, while Hawksmoor shuttered the two remaining branches of its sister restaurant Foxlow in June. </p>
      <p>The increasing popularity of  home delivery services such as Deliveroo and Uber Eats has created an additional sales channel but in some cases has also reduced more profitable in-person visits.</p>
      <p>Consumers choosing to order in rather than dine out has seen restaurant alcohol sales fall, affecting what is often a restaurant’s highest-margin product.</p>
      <p>UHY Hacker Young partner Peter Kubik said: “Many restaurant groups are finding it difficult to raise capital from their shareholders – they are finding their patience for putting in more money has run out. </p>

      <p>“There are now few restaurant chains that aren’t either considering a strategic restructuring or a reduction of their branch networks. </p>
      <p>“Restaurants are also taking action at a micro level such as simplifying their menus to reduce waste, cut costs and focus on their most popular dishes.”</p>
