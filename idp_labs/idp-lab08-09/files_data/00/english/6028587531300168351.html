      <p>No one likes being in second place. All the glory goes to the people who cross the line first. It goes to those who stand on top of the podium. And, it goes to those who have the best record of success.Of course, we all want to be first place winners in life and at work. But, standing at the front of the pack as the person or team to beat, comes with it’s own set of challenges and ample stress. Why is winning so stressful? Well, the reason is simple. The moment you stop winning, is the very moment you start losing. And, for those of you who have experienced this phenomenon, it can be a heavy psychological burden.</p>
      <p>While we interview many of the most successful executives and entrepreneurs around the world, we can’t help but notice one striking similarity among those who seemingly recreate success after success. It’s not that they always win. Instead, it’s because they are not afraid of losing—they know what it feels like, and have learned to pick themselves up and get back in the race, even if they lose again. In a nutshell, they maintain an underdog mindset, whether they’re winning or losing.</p>
      <p>What are the benefits of having an underdog mindset?</p>
      <p>1.    <b>You’re not worried about who is chasing your tail.</b> The most successful people and companies we’ve met never look back to see who’s chasing them. Instead, they simply march forward with ideas and optimism. There is no fear of who might catch up. Instead, the focus is only who they need beat in front of them, and how they’re going to do it.</p>
      <p>2.    <b>You don’t have “ways” yet.</b> A surefire way to suffer an unrecoverable loss is to win, and then create immovable expectations that the way in which you won will work tomorrow and every day in the future. True champions, those who learn to win consistently in any endeavor, understand that they need to constantly improve, evolve and reinvent their approach.   </p>
      <p>3.    <b>Your expectations are yours.</b> One of the biggest benefits of having an underdog mindset is that your expectations are yours, and yours-alone. As an underdog, the world (especially when there’s data and stats) expects you not to win. And, psychologically, this can be one of the most motivating elements in any competition—because you’re not trying to defend a reputation.</p>
      <p>4.    <b>Your priorities are your priorities.</b> In business, we often talk about values and <a href="https://www.octanner.com/global-culture-report/2019/purpose.html">purpose</a>. These are the things you truly care about. And, an underdog mindset allows you to remain focused on your purpose and values, rather than defending your title as the winner. Think about it. People and companies are always talking about their priorities. Your priorities never need to be mentioned. They are revealed in what you do.</p>
      <p>5.    <b>The result you create is always above and beyond.</b> Let’s face it; there’s nothing scarier than a determined underdog. Why? Because even if they continue to lose the battles, they slowly chip away at the winner with the intention of finally winning the war. This means, as long as the underdog continues to improve, they’re consistently winning.</p>
      <p>6.    <b>You question and analyze why you lost.</b> One the biggest benefits of an underdog mindset is that the first place winners often assume they did everything right. All the little mistakes they made in their race to success are over-shadowed by their winning, which never allows them to ask, “But, what did we do wrong?” Maintaining an underdog mindset (an assumption that you always are underrated, overpowered, and overlooked) keeps you always questioning what you did wrong, so you can make it right.   </p>
      <p>7.    <b>Everyone is cheering for you.</b> The stories we all love the most involve underdogs. We love seeing people, teams and companies challenge insurmountable odds to takedown, disrupt and overcome. If you have an underdog mindset, the world may not know your name yet. However, the so-called “big dog” in your category probably does know your name. They see you. And, they know the world is <a href="https://www.octanner.com/insights/articles/2019/11/5/_20_creative_ways_to.html">cheering</a> for you.</p>
      <p>Nobody likes losing. But, when you have an underdog mindset, you don’t fear losing. And, that’s one of the best competitive advantages any person, team or company can ask for.</p>
