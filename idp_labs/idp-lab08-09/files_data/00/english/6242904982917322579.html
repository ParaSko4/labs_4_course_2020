      <p>After excelling on his Black Stars debut against South Africa, Mohammed Kudus was expected to start at Sao Tome and Principe but he has been benched.</p>
      <p>Coach Kwesi Appiah named his first eleven for Ghana's second group match of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers against Sao Tome and Principe without the promising talent.</p>
      <p>A decision which has left many surprised considering the attacker impressed greatly the first match against South Africa in Cape Coast.</p>
      <p>Kudus replaced Alfred Duncan and scored a wonderful strike as the Black Stars won 2-0.</p>
      <p>Instead, Kwesi Appiah has picked Samuel Owusu to start as the only change from Ghana's team that won last Thursday.</p>
      <p>Black Stars will be hoping for their second win to move to the top of Group C.</p>
      <p>Kickoff for the match is at exactly 13:00GMT.</p>
