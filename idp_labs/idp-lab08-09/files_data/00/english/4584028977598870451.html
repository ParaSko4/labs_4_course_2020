      <p>A furious late-game rally from Mount Pleasant kept the pressure on Red Stripe Premier League (RSPL) leaders Waterhouse after they secured a 2-1 win over Humble Lion.</p>
      <p>The St Ann-based club seemed well on their way to a home loss after Rohan Richards had given Humble Lion the lead at the stroke of halftime.  With the advantage holding for most of the second half, Mount Pleasant only sprang into action in the final 10 minutes.  Sue-Lae McCalla finally brought the team back on level terms in the 86<sup>th</sup> minute and in the dying embers of the game, Jourdaine Fletcher scored again to leave Humble Lion stunned.  The win was the fifth in a row for the surging Mount Pleasant.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, the downward spiral continued for previous league leaders Molynes United who crashed to a fourth loss in five games following a 2-1 loss to UWI.  Sergini Frankson gave the promoted team the lead in the 13<sup>th</sup> minute but UWI struck back almost immediately when Shuwayne Barrett responded in the 17<sup>th</sup> minute.  Zhelano Barnes handed the visitors all three points from the penalty spot in the 57<sup>th</sup> minute.  In another game, ten-man Tivoli Gardens went down 1-0 to visiting Portmore United.  Forward Rondee Smith got the game’s only goal in the 72<sup>nd</sup> minute.  Elsewhere, a Dean-Andre Thomas double saw Dunbeholden snap a two-game winless streak with a 2-1 win over Vere United.</p>
      <p>In the late kick-offs, goals from Kenroy Howell (37<sup>th</sup>), Tremaine Stewart (74<sup>th</sup>) and Colorado Murray (83<sup>rd</sup>) saw Waterhouse come from behind to secure a comprehensive 3-1 win over Harbour View.  Bebeto McDonald had given the home team the lead in the 28<sup>th</sup> minute.  In the other game, Arnett Gardens cruised to a 4-2 win over Cavalier.</p>
