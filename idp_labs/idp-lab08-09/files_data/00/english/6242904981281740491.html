      <p>Awal Suleman, who shot to fame after invading Black Stars game against South Africa, says his dream to become a professional footballer in future.</p>
      <p>Suleman, a fresh nursing training college graduate, invaded pitch during the Black Stars 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers against South Africa last Thursday night.</p>
      <p>His reason for running onto the field was to take a selfie with Atletico Madrid star Thomas Partey, who scored in the match.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old was arrested by the police but was released on bail after two days.</p>
      <p>“I am not only a 400 meters runner, but I also play football. I am a midfielder and I play for London Rovers, a second division club here in Cape Coast,” Awal told Asempa FM.</p>
      <p>“I am a very good athlete and I play football too, but you know, after SS if you do not get help to pursue all become waste. Now I am combining football with my nursing job and will like to be a professional footballer.”</p>
      <p>“My role model has always been Thomas Partey that is why I run to the field as I wanted to take a selfie with him. I've now completed Nalerigu Nursing Training College and I am waiting for my posting."</p>
