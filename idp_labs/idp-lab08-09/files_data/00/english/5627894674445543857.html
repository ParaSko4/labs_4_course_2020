      <p>NEW YORK - The United States has the world's highest rate of children in detention, including more than 100,000 in immigration-related custody that violates international law, the author of a United Nations study said on Monday. <br/><br/>Worldwide more than seven million people under age 18 are held in jails and police custody, including 330,000 in immigration detention centers, independent expert Manfred Nowak said. <br/><br/>Children should only be detained as a measure of last resort and for the shortest time possible, according to the United Nations Global Study on Children Deprived of Liberty. <br/><br/>"The United States is one of the countries with the highest numbers, we still have more than 100,000 children in migration-related detention in the [US]," Nowak told a news briefing. <br/><br/>"Of course, separating children, as was done by the Trump administration, from their parents and even small children at the Mexican-US border is absolutely prohibited by the Convention on the Rights of the Child. I would call it inhuman treatment for both the parents and the children," he added. <br/><br/>There was no immediate reaction from US authorities. Novak said US officials had not replied to his questionnaire sent to all countries. <br/><br/><b>'Inhuman treatment'</b> <br/><br/>Novak said the US had ratified major international treaties such as those guaranteeing civil and political rights and banning torture, but was the only country not to have ratified the pact on the rights of children. <br/><br/>"The way they were separating infants from families only in order to deter irregular migration from Central America to the United States to me constitutes inhuman treatment, and that is absolutely prohibited by the two treaties," said Nowak, a professor of international law at the University of Vienna. <br/><br/>The US detains an average of 60 out of every 100,000 children in its justice system or immigration-related custody, Nowak said, the world's highest rate, followed by countries such as Bolivia, Botswana and Sri Lanka. <br/><br/>Mexico, where many Central American migrants have been turned back at the US border, also has high numbers, with 18,000 children in immigration-related detention and 7,000 in prisons, he said. <br/><br/>The US rate compared with an average of five per 100,000 in Western Europe and 14-15 per 100,000 in Canada, he said. <br/><br/>At least 29,000 children, mainly linked to Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) fighters, are held in northern Syria and in Iraq, with French citizens among the biggest group of foreigners, Nowak added. <br/><br/>Even if some of these children had been child soldiers, he said, they should be mainly treated as victims, not perpetrators, so that they could be rehabilitated and reintegrated in society. <br/><br/><b>Trump's immigration policy</b> <br/><br/>Since coming to office, US President Donald Trump has made strict immigration policies a cornerstone of his presidency. Under his "zero-tolerance" policy at the border, his government implemented a practice of separating families. Following public outrage, Trump formally ended the practice in June 2018, but immigration advocates say family separation continues in other ways. <br/><br/>Last week, an analysis of US government data by The Associated Press and PBS's Frontline showed 69,550 migrant children were held in US government custody over the past year. <br/><br/>AP and Frontline also found that children held in government custody spent more time in shelters and away from their families than in previous years. <br/><br/>In September, a judge blocked new Trump administration rules that would have enabled the government to keep migrant children in detention facilities with their parents indefinitely. <br/><br/>The judge said the rules conflict with a 1997 settlement agreement that requires the government to release immigrant children detained along the border as quickly as possible to relatives in the US and says they can only be held in facilities licensed by a state. <br/><br/>The American Academy of Pediatrics has repeatedly said that detention is not suitable for children, who may suffer numerous negative physical and emotional symptoms. <br/><br/>The Trump administration has faced harsh criticism of its temporary border patrol stations, where lawyers and internal government watch-dogs reported hundreds of children and families were held in squalid conditions.
