      <p>Ferrari boss Mattia Binotto will speak with Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc at the team’s Italian headquarters this week in the wake of their “silly” mutually-destructive clash in the Brazilian GP.</p>
      <p>The team-mates’ battle over fourth place ended in an acrimonious clash on lap 66 of an action-packed Interlagos race, with both Ferraris sustaining race-ending damage.</p>
      <p>While he did not cast judgement on where the balance of blame lay, Binotto described it as a “small collision that had a big consequence” and insisted “this sort of thing should never happen”.</p>
      <p>Appearing without the drivers in the team’s usual post-race media debrief, Binotto said: “Today they were free to fight, they knew that. We let them race.</p>
      <p>“The reason for that is we secured second place in the constructors’ and they were somehow battling for their own position in the Drivers’ Championship.</p>
      <p>“Free to fight doesn’t mean to do silly actions – especially between the two team-mates, between the two Ferraris. Today was simply a silly action.”</p>
      <p>The drivers initially blamed each other over team radio but a stewards’ investigation ruled that neither was predominantly at fault, and so no further action was taken.</p>
      <p>‘The Stewards determined that both drivers had the opportunity avoid or mitigate the incident,’ read a statement.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What now for Vettel and Leclerc?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The clash ended Ferrari’s sequence of 46 consecutive points finishes, a run which started the race after Vettel collided with former team-mate Kimi Raikkonen and Red Bull’s Max Verstappen off the start line in Singapore 2017.</p>
      <p>“I have heard from both drivers, but I will meet with them to discuss what happened,” said Binotto. “There will be time for the team to analyse the video and data. It is not a matter of fining or blaming.”</p>
      <p>He added: “It is a matter of recognising eventually what has been the actions and mistakes. Whether you are a driver or engineer or whatever you are doing, recognising mistakes is important because that can only make it better. – Sky Sports</p>
