      <h1>A Fresh Case of Bubonic Plague Has Now Been Confirmed by China</h1>

      <p>BEIJING (Reuters) - China's Inner Mongolia reported a fresh, confirmed case of bubonic plague on Sunday, despite an earlier declaration by the country's health officials that the risk of an outbreak was minimal.</p>
      <p>The health commission of the autonomous region said a 55-year-old man was diagnosed with the disease after he ate wild rabbit meat on 5 November.</p>
      <p>Bubonic plague is the most common form of plague globally and can advance and spread to the lungs, which is a more severe type called pneumonic plague, according to the World Health Organization.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Mongolia">Inner Mongolia</a> case follows <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/two-people-have-been-hospitalised-with-deadly-pneumonic-plague-in-china">two that were confirmed earlier this month</a> in Beijing. In both cases, the two patients from Inner Mongolia were quarantined at a facility in the capital after being diagnosed with pneumonic plague, health authorities said at the time.</p>
      <p>The Inner Mongolia health commission said it found no evidence so far to link the most recent case to the earlier two cases in Beijing.</p>
      <p>The patient in Inner Mongolia is now isolated and treated at a hospital in Ulanqab, the health commission said.</p>
      <p>A total of 28 people who had close contact with the patient are now isolated and under observation, and the commission said there are no abnormal symptoms found in them.</p>
      <p>Outbreaks in China have been rare, but large parts of the northwestern city of Yumen were sealed off in 2014 after a 38-year-old resident died of bubonic plague, known as "Black Death" in the Middle Ages and caused by the same bacterium as the pneumonic variant.</p>
      <p>Rodent populations have risen in Inner Mongolia after persistent droughts, worsened by climate change. An area the size of the Netherlands was hit by a "rat plague" last summer, causing damages of 600 million yuan (US$86 million), Xinhua said.</p>
