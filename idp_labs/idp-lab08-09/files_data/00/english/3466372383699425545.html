      <p>At 9 am on Monday, the air quality index (AQI) in the national capital stood at 207 against an AQI of 254 at the same time on Sunday.</p>
      <p>However, there was a respite on late Sunday evening as the AQI dropped to 198, which falls under 'moderate' category.</p>
      <p>Gurgaon on Monday recorded an AQI of 138 (moderate), while Ghaziabad 231, Noida 212 and Greater Noida 204.</p>
      <p>An AQI between 201 and 300 is considered 'poor', 301-400 'very poor' and 401-500 'severe'.</p>
      <p>Experts said strong winds due to western disturbance has helped dispersed pollutants in Delhi-NCR and other parts of north India.</p>
