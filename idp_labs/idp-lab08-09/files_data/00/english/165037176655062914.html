        <b>La Liga President, Javier Tebas, gave his opinion about Real Madrid having almost 30 hours less rest than Barca ahead of the 'Clasico' which will be played on the 18th December.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>"Football is more than Real Madrid and Barcelona</b>. How many times in the 38 matchdays does one team rest more than another? And when do they complain? <b>A league is not always aware of how much rest the big teams get</b> and the La Liga President cannot be counting the seconds that each one rests," <b>Javier Tebas</b> states in an interview which took place at the event 'Marca Sport Weekend' in Marbella.<b> Sergio Ramos stated that Madrid "are at a loss" due to the change in timetable.</b></p>
      <p>"Last year it was the other way around, Barcelona played us with lest rest. <b>It's funny that they don't protest, because they don't play in the SuperCup finals on the same day</b>. It is so difficult to play both matches on the same day. Then there's Easter, Christmas... Someone has to play in the Three Kings parade. The match has been scheduled for 21:00 when the parade in Vigo and the delivery of keys to the Three Wise Men has finished", he said about the Celta-Osasuna match that is held on January 5 and has caused criticism among some players.</p>

      <p>About the SuperCup in Saudi Arabia, Tebas<b> criticised</b> the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), direcetd by <b>Luis Rubiales, who highlighted that it will be the "SuperCup of equality"</b> despite being a country that does not respect diverse social rights, such as those of women.</p>
      <p>"The issue of Arabia is really tremendous. They are a focus of piracy, which for us is terrible. I hear the excuses that Rubiales makes to go and I think we have to<b> propose the Prince of Asturias of Concord to the friend Luis Rubiales,</b> because it is incredible the excuses he gives, it seems that he will fix the problems of women in Arabia," ironised Rubiales.</p>
