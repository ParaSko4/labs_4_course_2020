      <p>Netflix has <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/new-christmas-movies-tv-shows-on-netflix-in-2019-46763530">no shortage of holiday rom-coms headed your way</a> in November and December, so we totally understand if you're already feeling a little overwhelmed by which ones you should take the time to watch. There's only so many "small town woman who <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Christmas-Inheritance-Good-44449553">swears she's not going to fall in love</a>, who then falls in love with handsome stranger and also saves her bakery just in time for Christmas" plots we can take, you know? Luckily the streaming giant's <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/netflix-original-christmas-movies-46864148">upcoming original film</a> starring <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Star-Trek-Discovery-Trailer-43780029">Sonequa Martin-Green</a> and Romany Malco looks like a winner.</p>
      <p><b>Holiday Rush</b> revolves around popular NYC-based radio DJ and widow Rush Williams (Malco, <b>A Million Little Things</b>), who unexpectedly loses his job right around Christmas when his spoiled kids hit him with a list of pricey gift requests. Fortunately, his resourceful producer, Roxy Richardson (<b>The Walking Dead</b>'s Martin-Green), and his Aunt Jo (Darlene Love) come up with a plan to help him buy another station. The only catch? It means the Williams family will have to downsize their lavish lifestyle into something much simpler.</p>
      <p>Can they do it? And will they be able to get through the holidays with their Christmas spirit intact? We can't wait to find out. Watch the trailer above before <b>Holiday Rush</b> begins streaming on Nov. 28!</p>
