      <p>Some people tend to seek a reason to be happy, others to be angry, still others to be sad.</p>
      <p>It’s easy to understand <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/happiness">happiness</a> seekers, but what could motivate people to want to be angry or sad? Here’s my hypothesis:</p>
      <p>Many <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anger">anger</a> seekers seek stimulation—It’s more energizing to be furious at, for example, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/president-donald-trump">President Trump</a> or at the Never Trumpers. Also, finding things to be angry about—and they exist as well as do things to be happy about—legitimates bitterness about how the world has treated them. It also legitimates their world view as justifying anger.</p>
      <p>Similarly, many seekers of sadness find comfort in reinforcing their genetic and/or environmentally caused unhappiness. The sadness seeker’s world view is vindicated each time s/he finds something to be sad about.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Why change?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Being less angry or sad may make you feel better about your life, how you're living it, and how contributory you are. And you’re likely to make the people around you feel better about their lives and accomplish more. For example, an angry person often makes coworkers feel bad or inferior. So if the person reduces the tendency to anger, coworkers will likely feel better about themselves and thereby probably be more productive. And of course, at home, if the angry or sad person moderates their attitude and behavior, their romantic partner, kids, friends, and relatives’ lives will benefit. Plus, the person will likely have more options to make new friends and be better liked by existing friends and relatives.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Why an angry or sad person might <i>not </i>want to change</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Foundational change is difficult. It first requires the person to acknowledge that his or her natural, foundational self is so bad as to require replacement. And replacing a core attribute that's likely caused both by <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/genetics">genes</a> and environment isn't easy—Ask any psychotherapist.</li>
        <li>It may feel good to walk the earth a little sad—It can feel more peaceful, engendering a sense that you needn’t be so aggressive in the world.</li>
        <li>Anger can feel good: Adrenaline rushes are, intrinsically, an upper.</li>
        <li>Humankind is too intolerant of deviations from the norm. Sure, if everyone were angry or sad, it would be, well, a sad and angry world, not good. But in a society like ours, which venerates perkiness and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/optimism">optimism</a> over soberness and appropriate negativity, the angry or sad person deserves a place in the mix, a seat at the table.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>How to change?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Let’s assume that, like most people, you want to fit in better, to less often be rejected professionally and personally. A reversal of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/personality">personality</a> is probably impossible: A hothead is unlikely to become unflappable, a curmudgeon to become Pollyanna. But might any of the following help you take at least a baby step toward the mainstream?</p>
      <p><b>Consciously look for the good </b>in people, things, and society. And rather than instantly bury that wisp of positivity in negativity, take a moment to savor that admirable person, amazing iPhone, perfect rose, worthy writings (yes, including in Psychology Today), and life here compared with a not-so-developing nation.</p>
      <p><b>Do things you enjoy, that are unlikely to make you sad or angry.</b> My faves include watching movies at home with my wife and doggie, hiking, gardening, playing the piano, cleaning my home, and yes, writing my Psychology Today articles.</p>
      <p><b>Be around happier people.</b><i> </i>It may be best if they’re just incrementally more upbeat. A sad or angry person might roll their eyes at a Mary Poppins, or even get angry at him or her.</p>
      <p><b>Let <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/fear">fear</a> motivate you to change.</b> Sad and especially angry people tend to get sick more and die earlier.</p>
      <p><b>Picture the benefits.</b> Imagine family, friends, and coworkers liking you more and, in turn, doing nice things for you: for example, giving you their extra concert ticket, asking more about you, giving you that plum work project in Hawaii.</p>
      <p><b>Keep a log. </b>On your phone’s note app or on a pencil-and-paper memo pad, for one day, each time you feel angry or sad, write it down, including whether that serves you, others, or no one. Also, write each time you’re feeling happy or contented. For each of those, write whether that serves you, others, or no one. Before you go to bed, review the day’s notes and decide if you want to try to be any different the next day and if you want to keep the log for another day.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The takeaway</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you lean sad or angry, is that serving you? Do you want to take one or more of this article’s baby steps toward greater contentedness? Or are you satisfied with your level of sadness and anger?</p>
