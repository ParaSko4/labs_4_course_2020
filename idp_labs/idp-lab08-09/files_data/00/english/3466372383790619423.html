      <p>For decades, elite troops of the United States Marine Corps (USMC) have protected Washington's embassy in New Delhi.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, November 17, for the first time ever, the USMC showcased its professional skills in India, as the joint US-India tri-service exercise 'Tiger Triumph' hit the sea at Kakinada, off Visakhapatnam.</p>
      <p>Over the next five days, Indian and American soldiers, sailors, marines and airmen will operate together in a simulated 'humanitarian aid and disaster relief' (HADR) situation -- jointly providing succour to an Indian Ocean country that has been hit by a natural disaster.</p>
      <p>But the HADR scenario is only a convenient backdrop.</p>
      <p>In fact, the two militaries are honing their capability to work together in an amphibious landing -- such as a joint invasion of an enemy coast; or an operation to free one's own territory that has been captured by an enemy country, a terrorist group, or mercenary force.</p>

      <p>Incidentally, it was a joint US-Indian HADR effort -- in the wake of the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004 -- that birthed the current era of US-India military cooperation.</p>
      <p>Operating with the Indian Navy to deliver relief to Indonesia and Sri Lanka, the US navy reported to Washington that here was a regional partner worth having.</p>
      <p>The next year saw the US-India defence cooperation agreement.</p>
      <p>HADR and a real combat beach landing require similar military resources.</p>
      <p>The Indian side will deploy its biggest amphibious assault ship, <i>INS Jalashwa</i>; a tank landing ship, <i>INS Airavat</i>; and <i>INS Sandhayak</i>, a survey ship that will function as a hospital ship.</p>
      <p>The US task force will include the naval landing ship <i>USS Germantown</i></p>
      <p>Specially trained troops from the Third Marine Expeditionary Force -- a specialist unit for combat beach landings -- will be accompanied by a medical team.</p>

      <p>The exercise will involve sailing from Visakhapatnam to Kakinada, and then staging a shore landing and setting up a joint command centre and a joint relief and medical camp.</p>
      <p>For the Indian Army, this will be a chance to learn from amphibious landing masters, whose tactics date back to the Pacific Campaign in World War II, where they captured one island after another from the Japanese -- Midway, Wake Island, Iwo Jima and Guadalcanal.</p>
      <p>For the exercise, India is fielding a battalion group, from 19 MADRAS, and BMP-II armoured vehicles from 7 GUARDS.</p>
      <p>The Indian Air Force will deploy one C-130J Super Hercules aircraft, Mi-17 transport helicopters and a Rapid Action Medical Team.</p>
      <p>While Exercise Tiger Triumph is an early step in learning, and is therefore being carried out with fewer resources, a full-scale, tri-service beach landing operation is the capability that India is seeking to build.</p>

      <p>In such a combat operation, <i>INS Jalashwa</i>, or another Indian landing platform dock, would carry a battalion of soldiers (850 men), with armoured assault vehicles, to within 30 to 50 kilometres of the beach, from where smaller, flat-bottomed landing craft mechanised would carry the invasion force to the beach.</p>
      <p>To protect the invasion force during the beach landing, the <i>Jalashwa</i>'s six helicopters would heli-drop marine commandos behind the enemy troops that are defending the beach.</p>
      <p>In addition, naval frigates or destroyers would provide fire support, with their 100 millimetre main guns plastering the enemy's coastal defences.</p>
      <p>Simultaneously, IAF fighters, operating from shore bases, might also support the beach landing.</p>
      <p>Since 2000, the navy's Maritime Warfare Centre in Visakhapatnam has been refining these tactics.</p>
      <p>An Indo-US planning exercise, called <i>Habunag</i>, has coordinated expeditionary HADR activities with the US Navy.</p>
      <p>Now the USMC will have its word.</p>
