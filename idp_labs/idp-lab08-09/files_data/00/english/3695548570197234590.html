        <b>Surprise Macau Grand Prix winner Richard Verschoor has revealed that he clouted the wall while leading the race, which bent his steering and almost cost him victory.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Verschoor dived down the inside to lead event dominator Juri Vips after a safety car restart, and while Red Bull junior Vips stayed close, he was unable to find a way past including a move where he ran wide at Lisboa.</p>
      <p>Just after, Verschoor touched the wall and it meant he had to fight to keep his car on the road.</p>
      <p>"I tried to push really hard, but then suddenly I just touched the wall," Verschoor told Autosport, he and his MP Motorsport team winning at their first attempt in Macau.</p>
      <p>"All race I was fucking on the limit all the time, so I just did a bit too much.</p>
      <p>"Suddenly I turned to the right and I had to steer 90 degrees so I knew there was something wrong.</p>
      <p>"That for sure didn't make me quicker.</p>
      <p>"I really thought I wouldn't be able to keep up with him but I adapted quickly and we made it."</p>
      <p>Verschoor was dropped by Red Bull in 2017, and has since been given favourable deals at MP where he has contested GP3, F3 and Formula 2 thanks to the support of team boss Sander Dorsman and team owner Henk de Jong.</p>
      <p>He is the first Dutchman to win the race and the first rookie since Keisuke Kunimoto in 2008.</p>
      <p>"It's incredible, to be the first Dutch winner is of course really nice and historical," said Verschoor, who finished 13th in FIA Formula 3 this year.</p>
      <p>"I still can't believe what we just did.</p>
      <p>"For the team it was the first time here, for me the first time here, it's just incredible for us and I hope it gives the team a better name.</p>
      <p>"We were really not like how we showed this year, I'm sure that next year will be a lot better.</p>
      <p>"The team always kept believing in me and they show me so much. To give them this back is incredible for me."</p>

      <h3>Vips: DRS failure cost victory</h3>
      <p>Hitech Grand Prix driver Juri Vips dominated the Macau weekend, but said that the lack of DRS for a lap robbed him of victory in the Grand Prix.</p>
      <p>Vips led at the start but was passed by Verschoor shortly after a safety car restart. His DRS wouldn't open when he tried to retake the spot later on.</p>
      <p>In a consequent attempt at Lisboa, Vips braked too late, ran wide and his tyres were too worn to help him retake the lead.</p>
      <p>"I really think I would have won because DRS makes around a 15kph difference and I had my nose in front," Vips told Autosport.</p>
      <p>"Even without the DRS our pace was much faster.</p>
      <p>"In Macau I'm really proud of the team, they have given me a great car all weekend. Just a little bit disappointed with the end result."</p>
