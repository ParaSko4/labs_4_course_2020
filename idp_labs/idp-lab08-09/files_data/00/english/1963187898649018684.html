      <p>CAIRO - 18 November 2019: Chairman of Factory 200 Yosry al-Nemr revealed that entering the sector of electric vehicles manufacturing has started with city buses to be followed in order by travel buses, private buses, minibuses, taxis and cars. <br/><br/>In a meeting with the Energy and Environment Committee at the House of Representatives, Nemr said that his establishment has taken the first steps to accomplish the strategy devised to deepen the local manufacturing of electric vehicles. A deal was closed with a Chinese company in April to build a plant for manufacturing electric vehicles, and producing city buses has begun. <br/><br/>Representative of the Military Production Ministry Tarek Bakr discussed in the meeting the recommendations of the technical committee formed at the ministry to promote the use of electric vehicles. The main recommendations are exempting electric vehicles from tariffs for five years, exempting charging equipment, batteries, and feeding goods from tariffs and VAT, and setting a nominal fixed registration fee for electric vehicles. <br/><br/>Bakr highlighted that media has to raise awareness on the use of electric cars, underlining that although the price of an electric vehicle is high compared with a diesel one, its running costs are much less. The official pointed out that Egypt currently has 130 charging stations across the country operated by a couple of private companies.</p>
