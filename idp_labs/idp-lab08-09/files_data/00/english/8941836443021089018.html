      <p>CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) - A white man charged with making racist threats against a black activist in Virginia is asking a federal judge to postpone his trial.</p>
      <p>In a court filing Monday, an attorney for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/daniel-mcmahon/">Daniel McMahon</a>, of Brandon, Florida, requests more time to prepare for a jury trial currently scheduled to start Dec. 23 at the federal courthouse in Charlottesville. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/daniel-mcmahon/">McMahon</a>’s lawyer is seeking a new trial date in June 2020.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/daniel-mcmahon/">McMahon</a> was charged in August with posting social media messages to intimidate activist Don Gathers and interfere with Gathers’ plans to run for a seat on Charlottesville’s city council. An indictment says <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/daniel-mcmahon/">McMahon</a> expressed white supremacist views on his social media accounts.</p>
