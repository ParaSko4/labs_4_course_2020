      <p>"I'm dependent on the players and some of them have been with me from the start of the journey, helping France get very good results along the way.</p>
      <p>"There's personal pride, but most of all I'm proud of my players and their spirit."</p>
      <p>Tolisso's opener was the Bayern Munich midfielder's first international goal and he put it down to a pre-match pep talk with himself.</p>
      <p>"I'm very proud to have scored my first international goal and very happy," Tolisso said.</p>
      <p>"I said to myself before the game that I needed to make a run from a free-kick and that if the ball was going to come to me then so be it.</p>
      <p>"I made the run and the ball came to me and it paid off."</p>
