      <p>In the famous Charles Schultz “Peanuts” comic strip, time and time again Charlie Brown tries to kick the football out of Lucy’s hold. Each time he approaches, Lucy pulls the ball away and Charlie ends up on his back. Still, he tries again based on Lucy’s promise not to pull the ball. She does anyway. The market appears to be reacting to the “trade” file much like Charlie Brown, each time believing comments from the administration that, “A trade deal with China is imminent.” So, far, many false starts, but, no trade deal. Yet, based on that “hope,” U.S. equity indexes are at or near all-time highs.<b>The New Narrative</b></p>
      <p>Fed Chair Powell and other FOMC members continue to tell markets that the Fed has finished its mid-cycle correction (i.e., now on “pause”) indicating that it has completely unwound the 2018 over-tightening, and now that the “economy is in a good place,” i.e., no recession in sight, not to expect any more built-in interest rate reductions.   </p>
      <p>The markets apparently believe this, and those on the sell side now have a “new narrative”: Q4 will be the economy’s low point (no recession) and the industrial economies (U.S. and the world) will reaccelerate.  This new narrative is based on the Fed’s view, as expressed directly by Powell and indirectly by other FOMC members that “The Economy is in a Good Place.” No reason not to believe them, right? Oh, wait! This is the same Fed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>That got it completely wrong in 2018 and overtightened (the Fed thinks by 75 bps);</li>
        <li>Whose FOMC is the most divided on where policy should go at least since Volker was Chairman (1980s);</li>
        <li>That was completely surprised and caught flatfooted when overnight markets became illiquid and rates soared to 10% during their September meeting set;</li>
        <li>Who said adding $260 billion (and counting) to bank reserves via a balance sheet expansion wasn’t Quantitative Easing (QE).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>The New QE4</b>
      </p>
      <p>In this narrative, there is nary a mention of the of Fed’s balance sheet expansion since mid-September. Looks and acts very much like QE because QE is, by definition, balance sheet expansion. And, while some economists don’t think QE has any influence on equity prices, since the Fed “intervened” in the overnight repo market in mid-September, the S&amp;P 500 rose 4.1% from 2,998 on 9/16 to 3,120 on 11/15. No correlation?</p>
      <p>
        <b>The LCR Excuse</b>
      </p>
      <p>The “excuse” for this QE is the regulation called the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) required by Dodd-Frank. Under LCR, banks must keep enough liquidity on their balance sheets to survive a net cash demand of a 30-day stress period. Yes, carry enough liquidity on balance sheet – no allowance over that 30-day period to borrow or otherwise raise cash! Since the financial crisis of 2008 and passage of Dodd-Frank (2010), the Fed’s balance sheet has been swollen, and banks have had tons of excess reserves. Apparently, when the Fed was reducing its balance sheet last summer via Quantitative Tightening (QT) (the sale of its balance sheet assets), it wasn’t aware at what reserve level the LCR would begin to bind bank liquidity. This is a poor excuse, and another failure of this Fed. The Fed has had 9 years since Dodd-Frank’s LCR rule went into effect to have banks report those LCR needs.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Employment</b>
      </p>
      <p>It also appears that the November employment report (+128,000) has contributed heavily to the growth resurgence narrative. The Establishment Survey that markets have been giddy about is significantly biased by the BLS’s Birth/Death (B/D) model. (Because they don’t survey small business, BLS uses a mathematical algorithm based on history to guess at new small business formations. It always biases the Establishment Survey significantly to the upside when the economy is slowing.) According to economist David Rosenberg, about half of this year’s BLS Establishment Survey employment growth came from the B/D model plug number.</p>
      <p> The fact is, consumer confidence wouldn’t be falling if the labor market were that strong. Markets don’t yet recognize that the low level of the unemployment rate is structural (not enough workers). Look at Japan’s unemployment rate (2.2%) and the fact that there has been no growth there for years! In addition, the JOLTS data (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey) which is more comprehensive and detailed than the Establishment or Household Surveys show rising layoffs (+151,000 Sept.), falling job-openings (-277,000), and, always a barometer of job availability, a fall in voluntary quits (-109,000).</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Unrecognized Issue</b>
      </p>
      <p>There are two parts to what is going on in the economy. One is policy based (trade), the other is structural (demographics). The market recognizes the policy based issue(s), but not the structural ones, believing that if the trade deal is consummated, recession will be avoided, and developed world growth will return to “normal” post-WWII levels. Clearly, the trade issue has caused a lot of damage, especially to the business community. </p>
      <p>But, of importance, and what is not priced into markets, is that while the trade war has pulled the world’s economies back below their potential economic growth, demographics are reducing potential GDP growth, itself. These demographic trends are quite significant, quite negative, and extremely long-term.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Data</b>
      </p>
      <p>The markets continue to reach new highs based on the new narrative that Q4 will be the low point and that the U.S.’s and the world’s economies will reaccelerate in Q1. The data, however, do not bear this out. Industrial Production in the U.S. and in the developed world (Japan, Germany, China) is falling month by month. U.S. construction and capex data continue to weaken. And, while the narrative is that the U.S. consumer is strong, auto sales have been weakening and the sentiment indexes indicate consumer intentions to purchase big ticket items are on the downslope. GDP growth, which was 3% in Q1, has fallen each quarter this year (1.9% (prelim.) for Q3, and all the most watched econometric models are forecasting 1% or less for Q4. Freight movements in the U.S., i.e., the movements of goods by truck, rail or air, as measured by the Cass Freight Index are down -5.9% over year ago levels in October. The containers arriving at the two major So. California ports of Long Beach and LA are down significantly year to date. The OECD’s Composite Leading Indicator Index for the world has fallen for 21 months in a row, and its U.S. sub-index for 17 months in a row. Historically, such long trends have only happened in recessions. Central Banks have been and continue to reduce their administered rates, and inflation data continue to weaken, indicating sluggish demand. The list goes on…</p>
      <p>
        <b>Conclusions</b>
      </p>
      <p>The indications are that we will be seeing significantly lower job growth going forward. It is likely to be more apparent in the ADP data and in JOLTS than in BLS’s Establishment Survey (unless the B/D model bias is adjusted out). Still, even if we do end up with an official “recession,” it is likely that the unemployment <i>rate</i> will be a lot lower than in past recessions because of the demographic make-up of the labor force itself.</p>
      <p>As for the financial markets, the record highs for the popular equity indexes are all about the new narrative. The underlying data, however, tell a completely different story. Caution is warranted.</p>
