      <p>I was going to spend a big part of this review writing about how Siddiq and Rosita are clearly meant to be together. She’s spent more time with him and Eugene this season than with Gabriel. Siddiq is the father of her child. They seem close and they seem to genuinely like one another.<i>Spoilers follow, of course.</i></p>
      <p>But I can’t really do that now. Siddiq, in quite the shocking twist, has gone back to the mud. Dante, it turns out, was a Whisperer spy this whole time–something I find incredibly confusing for a whole bunch of reasons.</p>
      <p>Dante was visiting Siddiq after the doctor discovered the water was what was making everyone sick. He gives him a very nice pep talk and seems like he’s genuinely trying to lift Siddiq’s spirits. But Siddiq is still lost in his trauma, recalling how the Whisperers forced his eyes open while Alpha killed his friends. “Open your eyes,” one of them says, and Dante says the same thing.</p>
      <p>The pieces click together and Siddiq rounds on him, the realization obvious on his face. He goes for a weapon, but Dante is faster and bigger and the struggle is brief. Dante gets his “friend” in a choke-hold and kills him, though he doesn’t seem particularly happy about it.</p>
      <p>There were signs leading up to this, of course. We knew very little about Dante and he seemed like a nice guy, but when we discover that he “accidentally” gave the Whisperer prisoner hemlock, that’s a pretty big giveaway. He blames it on Siddiq, telling him that he’s the one who packed it, after all. How was he to know?</p>

      </figure>
      <p>But clearly, now at least, we know he killed the prisoner so that he wouldn’t talk–giving away the horde, but also very possibly giving away Dante in the process. He likely would have talked once he saw Lydia, also, though he was pretty psycho so maybe not.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, Dante must be so loyal to Alpha that he’s not bothered a bit by Lydia being alive despite Alpha telling her people that she killed her. That’s one point of confusion among many. The biggest question about Dante is “Why?”</p>
      <p>Why would he be a Whisperer in the first place? He seems too . . . normal. He certainly doesn’t come across like any of Alpha’s other followers, and he’s not a young girl who was forced into this life. So then why? What’s his story? It better be a compelling one, too, because as good as that twist was, I’m having a hard time buying Dante as a guy who wears a zombie mask and murders people. He’s a healer, for goodness sakes!</p>
      <p>I’m also genuinely bummed out that they decided to kill off Siddiq. He’s one of the most likable characters on <i>The Walking Dead, </i>and I just don’t think this show can afford to lose its best characters at this point. Doctors just don’t seem to last very long. This, after Jesus’s death</p>
      <p>I wonder how Dante will play this off, and what the fallout will be. Rosita will be crushed, of course. Will Dante be outed as a spy or will he find some way to cover it up?</p>

      <p>The rest of the episode focused on other Whisperer interactions. Carol tries to turn their captive Whisperer through kindness, taking Lydia’s advice to heart. She brings food instead of torturer’s gear.</p>
      <p>He seems to enjoy it at first, but it’s all a show. He spits the sandwich back onto Carol’s face and says some very unpleasant things to her as she beats him. Daryl steps in and threatens to cut the man’s fingers and ears off, but he’s no afraid. He tells them that Alpha loves and protects them and that he loves her and would gladly die for her–after all, she sacrificed her own daughter for them.</p>
      <p>This gives Carol an idea–just show the man Lydia and he’ll realize that Alpha is a liar. By the time she returns, he’s dead from hemlock poison that Dante “accidentally” gave him. So Carol takes Lydia out for some horseback riding, instead.</p>
      <p>They come to where Gamma and Aaron have been meeting. Gamma is gathering intel, apparently, while Aaron–in a weird about-face–is just trying to win her over through kindness.</p>
      <p>This is the same Aaron that for the first few episodes of the season recklessly attacked any Whisperer he saw and treated Negan with as much animosity as he could muster. I guess he just . . . ran out of steam? I’m really not sure, but I do think this show could use a little more consistency when it comes to character development. If you’re going to make Aaron all hot-headed this season–a whole “no more mister nice guy” routine–then you can’t just have him switch it off for no reason.</p>

      <p>In any case, he’s suckered into picking up his daughter’s drawing when Gamma drops it on the ground and the next moment she has him with a knife to the jugular. She’s sick of friendly conversation–after all, Alpha lashed her for not doing her job well because Alpha’s such a great boss and leader–and she means business.</p>
      <p>Then Carol and Lydia show up, and when Gamma sees Lydia she runs off, distraught. It wasn’t the death of her poor little sister that made her wise up to Alpha’s BS, but learning she lied about her daughter’s death was the last straw, or so it seems.</p>
      <p>Lydia feels inexplicably used at this point. Granted, Carol should probably have told her what was going on, that her mother lied about her death and so forth, but to say “You’re just the same as her!” is a little absurd. Showing Lydia to the other Whisperers is a smart plan, and one way to possibly turn them from Alpha without bloodshed, something that Lydia should want. I can understand her distress at learning what her mother had said, but to run off alone in the dark and throw a tantrum and blame Carol?</p>
      <p>That’s just enormously stupid, and I am mighty sick and tired of this show having characters do stupid crap just to heighten the drama. Fine, have Lydia be angry but don’t have her run off into the night–a night filled with Whisperers and zombies and other perils. It’s just not realistic at all.</p>

      <p>Oh well. This was, for the most part, a very good episode of <i>The Walking Dead, </i>and I’m glad that they’re still giving us surprise deaths. Far too often lately we’ve heard that someone was leaving long before they actually left–from Rick to Maggie to Michonne–and it’s refreshing to get another good shocker.</p>
      <p>I’m just disappointed that it was Siddiq, who I liked a great deal, and whose story didn’t really feel complete. As the “witness” to Alpha’s atrocities, I would have very much liked it if he stuck around to see her get what’s coming.</p>
