      <p>Deputy Local Government Minister, Osei Bonsu Amoah, has dismissed the claim that voting “Yes” in the upcoming referendum is a recipe for more confusion and chaos at the district level due to the country’s experience with multiparty democracy.</p>
      <p>Justifying his position in the upcoming referendum on December 17, 2019, on the Super Morning Show, Mr Osei Bonsu Amoah noted that a “No” vote will defeat the ultimate purpose multiparty democracy.</p>
      <p>According to him, although many Assemblymen have been opposed to the idea of making the district assembly elections partisan, it is also important to address the wrong notion that multiparty democracy was evil.</p>
      <p>He said it was necessary to correct the flaws of multiparty democracy.</p>
      <p>“It’s just like saying we have reckless people in the media so the media is not important or saying that chieftaincy can bring conflict, division and violence so chieftaincy is not important.</p>
      <p>“If that is how we want to look at it then we will not make any progress because no system is perfect and if you have a problem with a system you try to correct it rather than trying to bastardise or create an impression that it is not useful so don’t replicate it,” he said.</p>
      <p>He called on proponents of multiparty democracy to stand up to be counted because a ‘Yes’ vote in the referendum is a defence for multiparty democracy</p>
      <p>OB Amoah, who is also MP for Akuapem South, said it was strange that the biggest opposition party in Ghana, the National Democratic Congress (NDC), would campaign for a ‘No’ vote because multiparty democracy enabled the party to rule the country for some 16 years.</p>
