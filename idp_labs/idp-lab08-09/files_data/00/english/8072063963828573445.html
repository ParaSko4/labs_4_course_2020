      <p><b>(PRESS RELEASE) –</b> The St. Lucia Electricity Services Limited (LUCELEC) and the Civil Service Association (CSA) signed the collective agreement for the period 2011-2013, on Friday, November 15.</p>
      <p>The CSA represents the Company’s Grade 1 employees (Junior Staff). The signing took place at the CSA Centre in Sans Souci in the presence of Labour Officer Kissenger Smith.</p>
      <p>Six years ago, after the parties had signed off on all the clauses and exchanged letters confirming they had reached agreement, a dispute arose, which eventually went to the Labour Tribunal for review. It was over the CSA’s insistence on the inclusion of 15-point grade structure in a schedule to the agreement that it says was agreed to. The matter was eventually resolved earlier this year when the Labour Tribunal ruled that the 15-point grade structure should be included in the agreement.</p>
      <p>The company had previously paid to its Grade 1 employees all increases, benefits and retroactive payments negotiated for the period while the agreement was being prepared for signing in 2013. That includes the wage increases of 4%, 2% and 2% agreed to. With the implementation of the grade structure, LUCELEC will immediately make all outstanding payments to its Grade 1 employees.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the signing, LUCELEC Managing Director Trevor Louisy welcomed the closure of the matter. He says it had been a trying period for the entire LUCELEC Team and expressed the hope healing could now begin. He noted, too, that LUCELEC continues to be a responsible employer in ensuring that all employees are adequately compensated for the position they hold.</p>
