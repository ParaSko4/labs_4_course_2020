      <p>Intel has used Supercomputing 2019 (SC19) to announce a new category of GPUs based on the Xe architecture.<br/> <br/>The company is promoting the Xe GPUs as purpose-built for data centre artificial intelligence and high performance computing (HPC) workloads, rather than gaming.<br/> <br/>The chip giant has named the compute-focused graphics processing unit after a bridge in Florence -- the Ponte Vecchio.<br/><br/><b>See also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-the-gpu-became-the-heart-of-ai-and-machine-learning/">How the GPU became the heart of AI and machine learning</a></b><br/><br/>The Ponte Vecchio is already set to power the first exascale system in the United States, Aurora, which is housed at the Argonne National Labs in DuPage County, Illinois.<br/> <br/>The node architecture of Aurora system comprises of two Xeon Processors, called Sapphire Rapids, and six full-connected HPC/AI-optimised GPUs based on the Intel Xe architecture.<br/><br/>It's due for delivery in 2021.</p>

      <p>Also announced by Intel at SC19 was the oneAPI Initiative.<br/> <br/>According to Intel, oneAPI will "provide a unified and simplified programming model to deliver cross-architecture performance by allowing a diverse data-centric workload to benefit from the breadth of Scalar (CPU), Vector (GPU), Matrix (AI), and Spatial (FPGA) architectures". <br/> <br/>The oneAPI initiative is based on open specifications and standards, as Intel's way of encouraging cross-vendor adoption. It said there would otherwise be no common programming language or APIs and inconsistent tool support across platforms.<br/> <br/>Intel released its own implementation of oneAPI with a set of oneAPI Toolkits now available in beta, and an oneAPI developer cloud, which the company touted as providing developers access to a large portfolio of developer tools and a variety of Intel architecture-based systems.<br/> <br/>The oneAPI devcloud is a development sandbox to develop, test, and run workloads across a range of Intel CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs.</p>
