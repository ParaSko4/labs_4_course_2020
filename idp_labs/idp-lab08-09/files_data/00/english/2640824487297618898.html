      <p><b>before starting the project, the <a href="http://designstudioulab.com/">design team</a> read the book ‘in praise of shadows’, written by tanizaki junichiro.</b> according to junichiro, ‘shadow space’ is the dark place in architecture, like shade. in other words, the ‘shadow space’ means space that is neither too dark nor too bright. by referring to this idea, the architects embraced the notion of a softly-lit interior to create a place that amplifies imagination and creativity.</p>

      <p>view at the entrance</p>
      <p><b>therefore, the most important part of the design is the lighting of the space.</b> the team planned to lighten the entire office softly, by building a wall which contains the illumination in the center of the space while minimizing the external light. consequently, they tried to make place that enables all the team members to be lost in meditation.</p>

      <p>hall</p>
      <p><b>u.lab analyzed the office lifestyle to create the optimum space for team members.</b> they found that concentration and communication are the most important elements. the synergy created when communicating with other team members is a valuable process, therefore, they tried to draw the act of concentration and communication into the same place. so, two types of space were planned for everyone. each person can make concentrated thought in personal space, and share it with each other in the communication space.</p>

      <p>12m wall built by hemp cloth</p>
      <p><b>finally, a 12m wall built by two layers of hemp cloth divides the space and acts as the boundary between concentration and communication.</b> furthermore, they combined each function together, by installing two types of lighting to brighten the entire space. when considering which suitable material to use, the hemp blanket came to mind. they conceived that the hemp quilt arouses the idea of sunshine in the morning, which can be harmonized with this 90 year old building and the long history of the place.</p>

      <p>another type of lighting</p>
      <p><b>u.lab chose ‘shadow space’ to maximize imagination.</b> individual space stimulates concentration of each team member, and there is 8m long table, where the whole team can share their ideas. in short, the design aims to provide a space that allows team members to joyfully share their time and ideas.</p>
