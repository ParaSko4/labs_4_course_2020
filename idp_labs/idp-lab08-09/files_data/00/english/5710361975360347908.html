      <p>DUBAI (Reuters) - Jazeera Airways (KW:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/jazeera-airways">JAZK</a>) is not happy with Airbus (PA:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/eads">AIR</a>) production delays that have delayed delivery of aircraft to the airline and it has not plans to place an aircraft order at this week's Dubai Airshow, its chief executive said.</p>
