      <h2>Janus Henderson forecasts underlying rise of 5.4% this year, against 8.5% in 2018</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:04:20+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 00:04</time> by <a rel="author">Jennifer Thompson</a></address>
      <p>Global dividend growth is expected to falter next year as an <a href="https://www.ft.com/stream/7d930a0a-dcc3-4d19-86ef-b13af31cbcf1">economic slowdown</a> across much of the world hurts company profits.</p>
      <p>In the three months to September this year, total payouts to shareholders grew 2.8 per cent to a record $355.3bn, according to the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index report. Underlying growth — stripping out the effects of special dividends, currency movements and other one-off factors — was 5.3 per cent.</p>
      <p>However the report said underlying growth this year will be slower than in 2018 and that it is likely the trend will persist into 2020. “It’s not a disaster [but] we have seen downgrades to global economic growth,” said Jane Shoemake, investment director of Global Equity Income at Janus Henderson.</p>
      <p>The UK was boosted by one-off special dividends at companies including <a href="https://www.ft.com/stream/d04e0b51-341d-4604-8079-fdc3e46dc159">Royal Bank of Scotland</a> and <a href="https://www.ft.com/stream/80871faa-d16f-4c9f-b310-df42104dcecc">Rio Tinto</a> but underlying growth was weak at 0.6 per cent in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>About half of the Chinese companies tracked cut their dividends in the period, although for North America, the underlying growth rate was 8.1 per cent to a record level of $135.6bn.</p>
      <p>Global policymakers are increasingly warning that factors such as the <a href="https://www.ft.com/us-china-trade-dispute">US-China trade war</a> and political instability are harming growth prospects.</p>
      <p>Last month, the IMF <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/078e2ca2-ef2a-11e9-bfa4-b25f11f42901">sharply downgraded</a> its global growth forecast to 3 per cent in 2019, the lowest level since the 2008-09 recession. Recent research by the Brookings Institution think-tank and the Financial Times concluded the global economy has entered a period of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7e412720-ec3a-11e9-85f4-d00e5018f061">“synchronised stagnation”.</a></p>
      <p>Janus Henderson left its 2019 forecast of $1.43tn in global dividends unchanged. This is equivalent to a 5.4 per cent underlying rise, down from 8.5 per cent last year.</p>
      <p>Dividends have risen every year for a decade. Ms Shoemake said rises were bigger in 2017 and 2018 when economic growth was stronger but that 5 to 6 per cent was a more typical historic level and still encouraging.</p>
      <p>“We have been cautioning investors all year that the rapid dividend growth they have enjoyed in the last couple of years was set to return to more normal levels,” she said. “A softening global economy is beginning to have an impact on corporate earnings and, in turn, on dividends.”</p>
      <p>Telecoms group <a href="https://www.ft.com/stream/e0f5418d-c4ff-4e69-9511-274de430e726">AT&amp;T</a> is set to be the biggest dividend payer in the US this year for the first time since 2012, paying out about $14.9bn. <a href="https://www.ft.com/stream/2317ce6d-cc16-4022-964e-597b58ae7ddb">Shell</a> is set to retain its crown as the world’s largest dividend payer for a fourth consecutive year.</p>
      <p>Ms Shoemake said that, despite some gloom, investing in companies was still an attractive prospect for many given that interest rates were at historic low levels creating a lack of opportunities elsewhere for those seeking returns.</p>
