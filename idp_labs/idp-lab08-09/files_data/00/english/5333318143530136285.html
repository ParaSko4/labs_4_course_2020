      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.innovatorsmag.com/author/staff/" target="_blank">Staff reporter</a></address>
      <p>A new discovery by scientists in Germany could further unlock the potential of gene therapy to fight deadly diseases.</p>
      <p>To date, only six gene therapies have been approved for use in the EU. A major part of the problem here has been finding ways of getting healthy DNA to the target cell. In a bid to solve the transportation challenge, Dr Christian Wölk and his team of scientists from the Institute of Pharmacy at <a href="https://www.uni-halle.de/">Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg</a> (MLU) tackling this obstacle, have developed a vehicle ‘using artificial fats to transport DNA into cells’ rather than via ‘modified viruses’. The research, published in <i>Biomaterials Science,</i> could lead to an acceleration in gene therapies for various cancers and congenital diseases.</p>
      <blockquote>“The most recent studies have been very promising,” said Wölk.”We are convinced the system works.”</blockquote>
      <p>Wölk and his team are currently expanding their work in this area.</p>
