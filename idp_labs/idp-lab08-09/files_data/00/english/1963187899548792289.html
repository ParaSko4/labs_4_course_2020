      <p>Al Ahly suffered a second blow in a few days with Alio Diang suffering from a torn muscle. <br/><br/>The X-rays showed a tear in the connective muscle during his participation with the Mali team in the African Under-23 Nations Championship in Egypt and qualify for the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020. <br/><br/>"Diang's injury is a rupture of the connective muscle at a depth of 1 millimeter," said Ahly's football manager Sayed Abdul Hafeez. <br/><br/>"Diang needs 10 days of treatment." <br/><br/>"This confirms his absence from Al Ahly's match against El Gouna in the league scheduled for November 25th." <br/><br/>"Diang will be 90% ready for the Etoile du Sahel match and the medical team will try to equip him for the match," he said. <br/><br/>Diang missed the group training on Sunday evening after injury, after returning to team training on Saturday after his country's exit from the first round of the championship. <br/><br/>On Saturday, Diang only had training at the gymnasium. <br/><br/>The injury of the Mali player came a few days after Al-Ahly suffered a painful blow with Hamdi Fathi's injury to the knee cartilage in training Egypt.</p>
