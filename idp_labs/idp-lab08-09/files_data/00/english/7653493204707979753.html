      <p>The 50 US state attorneys-general currently investigating Google are preparing to expand their anti-trust probe beyond the company’s advertising business and include its Search and Android businesses.</p>
      <p>The development comes as politicians on both sides raise concerns over Silicon Valley’s growing economic and social reach.</p>
      <p>The attorneys-general will process subpoenas known as civil investigative demands, or CIDs, to support the inquiries, but they may not be served imminently.</p>
      <p>So far, the investigation has explicitly focused on Google’s advertising business.</p>
      <p>Search is the heart of Google’s business, through which Google collects both advertising revenue and data.</p>
