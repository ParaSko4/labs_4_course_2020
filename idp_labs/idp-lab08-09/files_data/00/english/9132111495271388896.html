      <p>Chief Executive Officer of Public Sector Reforms, Dr Thomas Kusi-Boafo, is of the view that God fearing is about being honest and responsible to the State by paying taxes to aid in development.</p>
      <p>According to statistics, only 1.2 million Ghanaians pay taxes to cater for the 28 million population.</p>
      <p>“It is surprising that the elite in society do not preach good morals. What I term as God fearing is being honest and responsible to the State by paying taxes to help. The first religion is your country, serving your country well makes the denominations relevant,” he said in an interview on Peace FM, monitored by Adomonline.com.</p>
      <p>He added that there is development in most European countries because many of the population pay taxes.</p>
      <p>“When you go to other countries even cab drivers pay taxes so they will not sit for their roads to be in a bad shape or filth to engulf their city and in every country those who don’t contribute are the insolent ones,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Kusi-Boafo urged pastors to take time to educate their congregation on the relevance of paying taxes.</p>
      <p>“Just as their congregations are eager to pay their tithes and offerings I will advise pastors to take 10 minutes of their time every Sunday to educate their congregation on the need to pay taxes,” he added.</p>
