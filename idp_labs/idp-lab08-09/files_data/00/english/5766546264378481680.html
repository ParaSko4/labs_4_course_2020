      <p><b>Houston, Texas – </b>Liberia’s own Taa Wongbe has been awarded the prestigious “30 Black Stars” award in Houston, Texas. The award, an initiative by Face2Face Africa Magazine, highlights and celebrates African, African-American, and Caribbean business and professional leaders.</p>
      <p>Face2Face Africa Magazine received hundreds of nominations from members of the business community and the 30 finalists were chosen by a Selection Committee led by Dorinda Walker, CEO of Cultural Solutions Group, based on their outstanding professional achievements, impact and contributions to the global community.</p>
      <p>“I am truly honored and grateful to be selected among these astonishing men and women! Being among my fellow honorees inspired me to do more, give more, learn more and grind more! I am also very proud to be representing Liberia in a positive light,” Taa shared.</p>

      <p>The 30 Black Stars initiative seeks to help advance diversity and inclusion, and foster meaningful dialogue on how corporations can harness the full potential of minority professionals and business leaders for innovation and global competitiveness. “We are proud to have such a dynamic group of honorees who together represent over 15 nationalities including USA, Haiti, Jamaica, Antigua and Barbuda, Ghana, Nigeria, Benin, Liberia, Zimbabwe and more. They have all distinguished themselves in the business and professional world, are transforming industries, and paving the way for other minorities through a commitment to excellence,” said Sandra Appiah, CEO of Face2Face Africa.</p>
      <p>Taa, who is the founder and CEO of the Khana Group (TKG), was the only Liberian among the 30 Black Stars and was selected for his work with TKG, a firm he founded over 11 years ago. Under Taa’s leadership, the firm has experienced drastic growth and expansion. Today, the firm is a leading research and strategy consulting firm with offices in Liberia, Ghana, Nigeria and the US. The firm has worked on over 300 projects in over 20 countries in Africa for private sector clients such as McKinsey, Dalberg, DAI, Coca-Cola and donor agencies such as USAID, The World Bank, DFID, The UN System and philanthropic organizations.</p>
      <p>When interviewed at the 30 Black Stars awards regarding the key contributors to his success, Taa shared that God and the people around him led him to where he is today. “First God and then the people around me. One of the things I learned as a leader is to surround myself with the best people. People who are competent, loyal, and very honest to you as a leader. You need people who will not only give you support and solid advice but will also tell you the truth when you are wrong.” Taa stated.</p>
      <p>The 30 Black Stars Awards was held on November 15, 2019 at the Royal Sonesta Hotel in Houston.</p>
