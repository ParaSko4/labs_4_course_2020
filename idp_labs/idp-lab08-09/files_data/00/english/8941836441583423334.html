      <p>DENVER (AP) - A Denver radio station says one of its hosts wasn’t fired in the middle of his show over criticism of President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>Craig Silverman said he was fired by news and talk radio station KNUS-AM Saturday during a segment about former Trump personal attorney Roy Cohn that included critical remarks about the president.</p>
      <p>But station general manager Brian Taylor said at a press conference Sunday evening that the show was interrupted because Silverman appeared on a competing radio station and announced that on his KNUS program Saturday.</p>
      <p>Taylor says Silverman is an independent contractor and wasn’t fired. He said Silverman’s contract remains in effect.</p>

        <p>Silverman, a lawyer and former Denver prosecutor, told KMGH-TV that his contract doesn’t prohibit him from appearing on other media outlets.</p>
