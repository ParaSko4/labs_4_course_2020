      <p>(ADDIS ABABA) – The Africa Industrial Week has kicked off  today at the premises of the African Union (AU) headquarters here in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.</p>
      <p>Africa Industrialization Week 2019 (AIW) is opened themed by, “Positioning African Industry to supply the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AFCTA) Market”</p>
      <p>It is to be recalled that the 25th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) 1989, declared November 20, to be Africa Industrialization Day.</p>
      <p>It was first observed on November 20, 1990.</p>
      <p>This year, the African Union in collaboration with partners have planned the week-long activities to mark Africa Industrialization Day (AID).</p>
      <p>The AIW-2019 is organized by the AU Commission’s Department of Trade and Industry in collaboration with International Trade Centre, Geneva, Ethiopian Ministry of Trade and Industry, the Africa Free Zones Organization, the UN Industrial Development Organization, the UN Conference on Trade and Development, the UN Economic Commission for Africa, European Union, among others.</p>
      <p>This year’s continental event, have attracted more than 1,000 African experts and policymakers from across the continent participating in the industry Week.</p>
      <p>The African bloc urged African leaders and other international actors to work together to ensure inclusive, rapid and sustainable industrial development on the continent.</p>
      <p>“mobilizing both African and leaders from the rest of the world, including international development organizations to advocate for the accelerated and sustainable as well as inclusive industrialization of Africa,” according to the AU statement.</p>
      <p>Encouraging startups, small and medium enterprises is the focus of Industry Week.</p>
      <p>This is said to strengthen the sector in the continent and help to compete in the international market.</p>
      <p>Africa’s Free Trade Zone is said to be implemented by July.</p>
      <p>The Africa Industrialization Day (AID), represents a unique platform to enhance international cooperation and dialogue on the pan-African industrialization agenda, and to raise awareness of the opportunities and challenges associated with this innovation drive. </p>
      <p>Every year it gathers African leaders, policy makers, and representatives of the private sector, academia, international financial institutions (IFIs) and development partners to showcase the continued relevance of industry, including manufacturing production, as a powerful engine to build the Africa we want as underlined in Agenda 2063.</p>
      <p>According to the African Union Trade and Industry Commission report, the African Continental Free Trade Agreement covers a market space of at least US $ 3.4 trillion, and a consumer base of 1.27 billion.</p>
