        <b>Spain will face Romania on Monday in the 2nd match of the international break. The match will be played at the Metropolitano, the stadium where Ramos and Morata received a beautiful surprise.</b>
      </p>
      <p>There are times that we all need a nudge, and that is what happened to the CB and striker.</p>
      <p>Spain trained in the morning in a quieter session under Robert Moreno, but at the end,<b> both Ramos' and Morata's wives were waiting</b>.</p>
      <p>Both players' wives <b>were with their children</b>, so they could not have a greater smile a few hours from the match.</p>
