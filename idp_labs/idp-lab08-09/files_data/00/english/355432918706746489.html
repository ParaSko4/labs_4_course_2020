      <h1>Biden says he won't legalize marijuana because it may be a 'gateway drug'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:23:08+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 00:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/owen-daugherty" target="_blank">Owen Daugherty</a></address>
      <p>Former Vice President <a href="https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a> defended his reasoning to not legalize marijuana on a federal level if elected president, saying there is not “enough evidence” as to “whether or not it is a gateway drug.”</p>
      <p>Speaking at a town hall in Las Vegas on Saturday, the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate said whether the U.S. should legalize cannabis on a federal level is still up for debate as far as he is concerned.</p>
      <p>“The truth of the matter is, there’s not nearly been enough evidence that has been acquired as to whether or not it is a gateway drug,” Biden said, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-marijuana-gateway-drug-but-research-doesnt-support-that-2019-11/?utm_source=reddit.com">according to Business Insider</a>. “It’s a debate, and I want a lot more before I legalize it nationally. I want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it.”</p>
      <p>Biden, as he has <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/444105-biden-backs-decriminalizing-marijuana">throughout his time on the campaign trail</a>, said he supports medical marijuana and insisted possession of the substance "should not be a crime."</p>
      <p>But he also said Saturday that he thinks the decision to legalize marijuana should be left up to individual states.</p>
      <p>“States should be able to make a judgment to legalize marijuana,” he said at the town hall.</p>
      <p>As for legalization on a federal level, Biden said more research is needed.</p>
      <p>"It is not irrational to do more scientific investigation to determine, which we have not done significantly enough, whether or not there are any things that relate to whether it's a gateway drug or not," Biden said.</p>
      <p>Several of his top Democratic rivals in the race have thrown their support behind legalizing marijuana, which is currently classified as a Schedule I substance, which the Drug Enforcement Administration defines as drugs “with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.” Other Schedule I drugs include heroin and LSD.</p>
      <p>Biden’s campaign previously noted the former vice president would reschedule the substance as a Schedule II drug to aid in researching its health impacts.</p>
      <p>Sens. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/cory-booker"/><a href="https://thehill.com/people/cory-booker">Cory Booker</a> (D-N.J.), <a href="https://thehill.com/people/elizabeth-warren"/><a href="https://thehill.com/people/elizabeth-warren">Elizabeth Warren</a> (D-Mass.), and <a href="https://thehill.com/people/bernie-sanders"/><a href="https://thehill.com/people/bernie-sanders">Bernie Sanders</a> (I-Vt.) have all said they would make marijuana legal on a federal level if elected president.</p>
      <p>Democratic presidential candidate <a href="https://thehill.com/people/andrew-yang">Andrew Yang</a> in a tweet Monday morning said he believes marijuana should be legal throughout the country, a position he has held since releasing a plan that would pardon individuals who are imprisoned for nonviolent marijuana convictions.</p>
