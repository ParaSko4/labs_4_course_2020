        <b>Newboy Christopher Antwi-Adjei will have to wait for his first Ghana game after he was named on the bench for the Black Stars match against Sao Tome. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The Paderborn SC winger arrived in Ghana on Thursday and missed the game against South Africa.</p>
      <p>However, he made the trip to Sao Tome and Principe for the AFCON 2021 qualifier on Monday.</p>
      <p>Despite being born in Germany, the winger chose the country of his parents for his international career.</p>
      <p>“Getting the call up is one dream, and playing is the ultimate. It will be a dream come true for me to wear the Ghana shirt,”he told Ghanafa.org.</p>
      <p>Coach Kwesi Appiah could hand the 25-year old a cap in today's game but it will be from the bench.</p>
      <p>The Black Stars started the 2021 Nations Cup qualifier with a win against the Bafana Bafana of South Africa and a win against their opponents today will see them climb top of Group C.</p>
