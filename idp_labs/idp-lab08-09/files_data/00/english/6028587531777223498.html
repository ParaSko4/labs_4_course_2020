      <p>On Oct. 17, 2018, Carmelo Anthony made his debut with Houston, entering the Rockets’ game against New Orleans with 7:12 left in the first quarter. Remarkably that appearance, in his 1,055<sup>th</sup> NBA game, was the first time he came off the bench in a professional career that started in 2003.Anthony, in a move that caught many by surprise, has agreed to a non-guaranteed deal to join the Trail Blazers. The deal has drawn predictably mixed reviews, with the Athletic’s John Hollinger <a href="https://twitter.com/johnhollinger/status/1195330747696963585">using the word “desperate.”</a> Anthony’s fellow players, however, <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/portland-trail-blazers/social-media-reacts-report-blazers-signing-carmelo-anthony">were far more supportive</a>.</p>
      <p>With Anthony’s recent struggle to find a team, it’s easy to forget just how big a figure he once was in the NBA. Anthony has been selected to 10 All-Star Games, eight times as a starter, selected via fan vote. The first time he suits up for the Blazers – possible Tuesday at New Orleans – he’ll tie Clyde Drexler for Portland player with the most All-Star selections (Drexler was picked eight times while with Portland, twice with Houston, and was voted a starter four times).</p>
      <p>At 35, no one expects Anthony to be an All-Star. But the Blazers do have some major holes to fill that Anthony could help with, if he is willing be a role player. Three questions to ponder:</p>
      <p><b>How will Anthony affect the Blazers’ chemistry?</b> This seems a genuine concern among fans. Chemistry on sports teams doesn’t exactly work like actual chemistry – you don’t add one compound and see it immediately affect everything else. But bad chemistry is certainly something any team wants to avoid.</p>
      <p>The Blazers have enjoyed good, even great, chemistry in this current era, led by star players Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum, and coach Terry Stotts, who have set a supportive, yet demanding, culture. Anthony seems to be well liked around the league personally, and Lillard and McCollum have both expressed support for bringing in Anthony, even <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/portland-trail-blazers/carmelo-anthony-portland-damian-lillard-and-cj-mccollum-make-their-pitch">going back to 2017</a>.</p>
      <p>Anthony’s stints the last two seasons, with Oklahoma City and Houston, were not great, but there were certainly chemistry considerations in playing with strong personalities in OKC’s Russell Westbrook and Houston’s James Harden and Chris Paul, not to mention a reunion with Rockets coach Mike D’Antoni, with whom he had a <a href="https://www.sny.tv/knicks/news/dantoni-quit-knicks-because-of-carmelo-but-wants-him-in-houston/285296952/">rocky relationship with the Knicks</a>.</p>
      <p>Stotts has a great capacity for making players comfortable and working with their strengths. Portland seems a good fit for Anthony at this point in his career.</p>
      <p><b>What will Anthony’s role be? </b>When the Blazers acquired Enes Kanter off the waiver wire in February, Stotts immediately announced that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/miketokito/2019/02/16/trail-blazers-load-up-for-stretch-drive-with-2-starting-caliber-additions/#39ca59eef3c0">Kanter would be the backup center</a>, shunting aside Meyers Leonard, who had been part of the rotation all season. Starting center Jusuf Nurkic was lost for the season just over a month later, so all that turned out not to matter.</p>
      <p>The question for Anthony is whether he should start at power forward, a spot that has seen a rotating cast after Zach Collins suffered a shoulder injury in the third game of the season that will sideline him until February at the earliest.</p>
      <p>Veteran Anthony Tolliver, free agent signee Mario Hezonja and rookie Nassir Little have all started in the spot, and none has been quite ideal. <a href="https://www.blazersedge.com/2019/11/17/20969320/portland-trail-blazers-rookie-nassir-little-provides-needed-energy">Little has been a genuine spark</a> with his athleticism and energy, but he’ll have to develop a more consistent shot to prevent teams from blitzing Lillard and McCollum. Against San Antonio on Saturday, Little did not hesitate in taking open 3-pointers, but after making his first attempt, missed his final four. Still, he has been a much-needed breath of fresh air  in the role.</p>
      <p>Whether Stotts opts to turn to Anthony as a starter might depend on how Little does. It also remains to be a seen if Anthony can be an effective bench player, especially as there is such a small sample size of bench numbers for a player who started 1,056 of the 1,064 NBA games he has played.</p>
      <p><b>Is Anthony a season-long player? </b>Considering how short his 10-game stay with the Rockets was, it’s worth pondering if Anthony is being brought in to patch a hole until Collins, Nurkic and Pau Gasol are able to play again, or if Anthony will be part of Portland’s plans the rest of the season.</p>
      <p>The chance for Little to develop quickly could be affected, but the Blazers are in more of a win-now mode than developmental, even with a 5-8 start, and at 19, Little has plenty of time to improve.</p>
      <p>Typically when players are signed to non-guaranteed deals, Jan. 10 looms as a key date, when contracts become fully guaranteed. But Anthony is no journeyman worried about a paycheck, having made $259 million during this career. The $2.2 million he could make, as estimated by <a href="https://heavy.com/sports/2019/11/carmelo-anthony-contract-salary-portland-blazers/">Heavy.com</a>, should be not be make-or-break for him, and the Blazers are carrying so much salary, cutting or keeping a veteran’s minimum won’t make much impact on their luxury tax bill either way.</p>
      <p>That’s one reason signing Anthony is a reasonable move for Portland.</p>
