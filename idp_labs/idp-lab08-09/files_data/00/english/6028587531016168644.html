      <p><a href="https://madeincookware.com/products/blue-carbon-steel-frying-pan"><b>Made In’s Carbon Steel Skillet</b></a><b>: </b>Dreaming of sizzling bacon over an open flame, but dreading dragging a heavy cast iron pan along?  Check out carbon steel —a hybrid of a cast iron skillet and a stainless steel frying pan, it has a cast iron’s heat retention, seasoning, and non-stick properties mixed with stainless steel’s heat control, lightness and cooking speed. The Made In Blue Carbon Steel Frying Pan ($69) is versatile and easy to clean—as long as you take the time to properly season it before your trip. Cook eggs for breakfast, then sear fish or veggies for dinner. When you're done, you can wipe clean with a little water and a towel. </p>

Save your glamping friends that fate with a Patagonia gift box, stuffed with everything from Wild Sockeye salmon to chili. Gift boxes start at $48 for their delicious smoked salmon, but I like the Pantry Stocker ($99), which includes everything you need from breakfast through cocktail hour and dinner. It’s all sustainably sourced, natch, thoughtfully packaged and takes meals way beyond hot dogs with minimal effort.</p>

      <p><a href="https://actandacre.com/products/cleanse-conditioner-travel"><b>Act+Acre Travel Essentials</b></a>: Sure, you could bring a blow dryer on your next glamping trip, but why disturb the peace? The Act+Acre Intelligent Towel is ultralight and designed to cut drying time. It wraps into a cute fuzzy turban, and after a couple minutes, you can shake out your hair and go natural. The Travel Essentials gift set comes with a travel size of their Cold Processed® Hair Cleanse (3 oz) and Cold Processed® Hair Conditioner (3 oz), packaged in a leakproof bag perfect for tossing in your pack.</p>

Woven in the USA and patterned after blankets early shepherds used to brave the elements, it’s perfect to wrap around shoulders while stargazing, or for an extra layer in the yurt at night. Pair it with the optional carry strap if you want to grab and go.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.buddhaboard.com/#products"><b>Mini Buddha Board</b></a><b>:</b> Give the gift of Zen with this travel-size board ($14.95) measuring a slight 5 inches square, and folding flat. It lets you “paint” with water and then watch as it slowly disappears. The idea is to tune into the moment, not worry about mistakes or any messy clean up at the end. Slip it into a Christmas stocking to turn anyone into an artist.</p>
      <p><a href="https://snowfox.fun/"><b>Snowfox Stainless Steel tumblers</b></a><b>:</b>  Sipping Champagne from a red Solo cup just doesn’t cut it – it’s bad for the wine and bad for the environment too. Instead, give the gift of flutes from SnowFox. Made from insulated stainless steel, this collection includes everything from martini glasses to beer tumblers, keeping drinks at just the right temperature. A thin one-millimeter rim allows you to taste the bubbly, not the cup.</p>

        <figcaption>The Atlas Explorer Kit is a great way to keep track of your travels.<cite>Tribute Products</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><a href="https://tributeproducts.com/products/atlas-project-combo"><b>Atlas Explorer Kit</b></a>: This thoughtful stocking stuffer includes a tiny plastic jar to put a bit of rock or soil from everywhere you’ve traveled. Start with some dirt from home, and add grains of sand from your favorite glamping on the beach spot, a bit of a limestone pebble from the Loire and some soil from Big Sur – the founders call it carrying the world in your hands. The kit also comes with a fabric map of the world for tracing your travels, and a journal.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.skinauthority.com/SkinSuit-Face"><b>SkinSuit™ sunscreen</b></a>: This lightweight sunscreen protects from UV radiation, pollution, blue light, and infrared light and also color-corrects minor skin imperfections– giving a youthful glow that just begs for a whole lot of selfies. This mineral-based lotion is reef-safe, and free from parabens, added dyes and perfumes, and it’s not tested on animals –meaning you give it to your loved one to tote guilt-free into the great outdoors.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.royalrobbins.com/collections/mens-bug-barrier"><b>Royal Robbins Bug Barrier clothing</b></a>: Between Lyme and Zika and all the other nasties carried by bugs in the woods, it’s important to use repellant– even when glamping. Wilderness camp instructors and wildlife biologists swear by treating clothes with Permethrin – a synthetic form of an insecticide produced by chrysanthemums. It is odorless, kills ticks and mosquitoes on contact, and nearly nontoxic to humans. Available in men’s and women’s styles, the Royal Robbins line uses special technology to bond Permethrin to the clothes for up to 70 washings – the expected life of the product. Not only does it assassinate bugs, it’s soft and stylish as well.</p>
