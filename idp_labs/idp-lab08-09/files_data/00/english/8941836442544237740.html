      <h1>MSNBC apologizes after forgetting Andrew Yang — again</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/jessica-chasmar/" target="_blank">Jessica Chasmar</a></address>
      <p>MSNBC apologized Sunday after an on-air graphic listing the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates failed to mention businessman <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/andrew-yang/">Andrew Yang</a>.</p>
      <p>MSNBC first apologized on-air after an Iowa Democratic Caucus graphic on “Up” included low-polling candidates such as Michael Bennet, who is polling at less than 1% in the state, but didn’t include <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/andrew-yang/">Mr. Yang</a>, who is polling at 2.6%.</p>
      <p>After facing significant blowback for the mistake, MSNBC apologized in a tweet and corrected the graphic, Mediaite <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/tv/msnbc-apologizes-issues-on-air-correction-for-leaving-andrew-yang-off-polling-graphic/">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>“Earlier on UP, we aired a poll graphic that inadvertently left off @AndrewYang. This was a mistake that we’ve since corrected on air. We apologize to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/andrew-yang/">Mr. Yang</a>. Here’s the correct graphic,” the network wrote.</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first time MSNBC and other major media news outlets, including NBC News, have forgotten about <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/andrew-yang/">Mr. Yang</a>. In October, MSNBC left <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/andrew-yang/">Mr. Yang</a> off a graphic listing how much cash each 2020 Democrat had on hand.</p>

      <p>“Thank you @MSNBC for making this apology for the 15th time. The #YangGang is very excited for #16,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/andrew-yang/">Mr. Yang</a>’s campaign manager, Zach Graumann, tweeted Sunday night.</p>

        <p>“Good thing we don’t need @msnbc to talk to voters - we just go straight to them,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/andrew-yang/">Mr. Yang</a> wrote in a tweet of his own. “Thank you #YangGang for making that possible.”</p>
