      <p>FERNDALE, Mich. (AP) - Michigan Secretary of State <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jocelyn-benson/">Jocelyn Benson</a> says her department is making it easier for transgender people to get a driver’s license or state ID card.</p>
      <p>Starting Monday, those wanting to correct the sex designation on their license can go to a branch office to have their photo taken, fill out a form and pay $9. They no longer will need to provide a birth certificate, passport or court order.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jocelyn-benson/">Benson</a> announced the policy change at a news conference in the Detroit suburb of Ferndale, where she was joined by LGBT advocates. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jocelyn-benson/">Benson</a> says studies show that about 80% of Michigan’s transgender population lacks proper identification.</p>
