      <h1>Chinese IPOs In The U.S. Declining In Current Crosswinds</h1>

      <p>As the U.S.-China tech and trade battle lingers on, one impact is already playing out in the future of Chinese companies going public in the U.S. Nasdaq senior vice president Bob McCooey predicts a slight slowdown in the number of Chinese companies listing in the U.S. this year. He expects the year 2019 to wind up with 35 to 38 Chinese IPOs in New York, he said at the East Tech West summit in Nansha, China. That's less than the 40 he predicted earlier in the year. But it’s still an active pathway especially considering the tensions between the U.S. and China that often centers on technology issues.  </p>
      <p>Investors are worried about the underlying China-U.S. pressures, which is creating uncertainty and lower valuations. "Some will wait for certainty before going ahead with IPO plans," said McCooey, chairman for the Asian region and responsible for business development.  </p>
      <p>One possibility increasingly heard in Washington, D.C. is a ban on future listings of Chinese companies on Nasdaq or NYSE. Asked if he thinks this ongoing issue could cause those already publicly traded on Nasdaq or NYSE to delist, McCooey said he believes that is doubtful. He noted that many companies already have offshore structures in place to go public in the U.S. and suggested it would be too costly for them to restructure and relist on domestic Chinese exchanges. </p>
      <p>But McCooey did not rule out another possible scenario – restrictions on U.S. pension funds from investing in Chinese companies that publicly trade on U.S. exchanges. </p>
      <p>In this heated environment, it remains to be seen if more Chinese companies will follow the Alibaba recent route of a dual listing, in the U.S. and in Hong Kong. </p>
      <p>The next generation of Chinese startups may opt to go public on one of China's Nasdaq-styled boards. Or they may pursue the same path as Chinese smart phone maker Xiaomi and superapp Meituan, which went public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2018 and raised $4.7 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively.</p>
      <p>McCooey noted that going public in New York is still seen by entrepreneurs and their venture investors as the trophy. Last year, four of the top 10 companies listing in the U.S. were from China - video streaming site iQiyi, electric vehicle maker NIO, social commerce upstart Pinduoduo, and music streaming service Tencent Music Entertainment. </p>
      <p>To give this more context, consider that out of 190 U.S. IPOs that raised $47 billion in 20188, China scored 31 IPOs that pulled in $8.5 billion, up from 16 at $3.3 billion in 2017 – an eight-year high since Alibaba’s mega $25 billion IPO in 2014.</p>
      <p>As China’s tech innovation boom continues, look for the marketplace dynamics to give Nasdaq and NYSE increased competition from China.</p>
