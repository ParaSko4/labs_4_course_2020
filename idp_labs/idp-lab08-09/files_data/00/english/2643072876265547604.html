      <p>
        <i>“This victory is not for the party or its members alone, but for the entirety of Nigerians.</i>

      <p><i>“May I call on the two governors-elect to be magnanimous in victory. The APC stands for the good of Nigerians, and I know the two governors-elect are part of the journey to make Nigeria better,</i>” the Speaker said.</p>
      <p>He called on the people of the two States, including members of the opposition parties, to join hands with the governors-elect to make their States great.</p>
