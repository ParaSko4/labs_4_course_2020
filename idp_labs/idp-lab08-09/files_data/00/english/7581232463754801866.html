      <p>With growing concerns over a multitude of food risks, accurate and sensitive analytical tools are needed to ensure food safety. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has become an indispensable method for food safety testing and quality control, capable of detecting and quantifying even trace amounts of numerous contaminants and harmful species in food.<br/><br/><b>Here we will discuss:</b></p>
      <p>- Allergen biomarker selection for LC-MS quantification.</p>
      <p>- How LC-MS can detect tiny quantities of harmful substances in foods and food contact materials.</p>
      <p>- The role of LC-MS in mycotoxin detection.</p>
