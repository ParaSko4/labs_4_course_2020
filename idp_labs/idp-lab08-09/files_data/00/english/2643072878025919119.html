      <h1>Jesus Will Complain About Nigeria’s Situation If He Were To Be Here – Obasanjo</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Enioluwa Adeniyi</a></address>
      <p>The former President of Nigeria, <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/olusegun-obasanjo/"><u><b>Olusegun Obasanjo</b></u></a>, while speaking on the state of Nigeria, stated that if Jesus Christ were to be in this country at this time, he would complain about the way the country is being run by the people in power.</p>
      <p>Obasanjo stated this while speaking at the 64th annual national convention of the Foursquare Gospel Church held at the church campground on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Ajebo, Ogun State.</p>
      <p>The former President in his statement charged clerics not to be quiet about happenings in the country but always speak the truth to people in authority.</p>
      <p>Obasanjo urged Christians to follow the lifestyle of Jesus and preach unity among themselves, adding that failure to do so might make them become preys to the enemies.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“As Christians, we have to be like Christ as we are transformed into the likeness of Christ or little like Christ.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>He urged everyone in position, situations and events to be guided in their dealings and action, and ask themselves the question that if Christ was in that position what will he do?.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“We have a lot to do in the situation we found ourselves in this country today. And make no mistake about it. If we don’t get together and stay together, we would be devoured and that, we should not take lightly.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“For me, if Christ was in Nigeria today, He would not keep quiet. He would say it as it should be said. He would speak truth to power. He would have no fear and he would have no intimidation.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Children of God, you have a responsibility to do and say what Jesus Christ would have done and said if he was in Nigeria today”.</i>
