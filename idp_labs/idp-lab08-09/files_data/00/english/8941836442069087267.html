      <p>SCARBOROUGH, Maine (AP) - A Maine town is considering possible locations and details for a new community center.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/portland-press/">Portland Press</a> Herald reports Scarborough plans to go over the questions of where the center would go, who would build it and how much it would cost over the coming months.</p>
      <p>A proposal pitched by developers of the horse-racing track Scarborough Downs has town officials discussing leasing a custom-built facility that would be part of a privately owned sports complex.</p>
      <p>The complex would include an indoor ice rink and pool, fitness room and other amenities. The center would be funded through a combination of property taxes as well as user and membership fees.</p>
      <p>A meeting with developers is scheduled for Nov. 26.</p>
