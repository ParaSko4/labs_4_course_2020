        <b>Avintia has announced the renewal of its contract with Ducati and will receive improved manufacturer support, paving the way for Johann Zarco to join the team in MotoGP next year.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Zarco has been linked to a place at Avintia over the course of the Valencia Grand Prix weekend, though dismissed the idea of joining it to Autosport and branded it as "not a top team".</p>
      <p>He added that he would rather go back to Moto2 than race for Avintia in the same debrief, with a potential opening at Marc VDS available in place of Alex Marquez, who is highly likely to join the works Honda team in MotoGP.</p>
      <p>However, Autosport revealed on Monday that a meeting was held between Ducati management and Avintia boss Raul Romero in which all three tried to convince Zarco of the validity of the project.</p>
      <p>Now Avintia has confirmed an extension of its deal to be a Ducati customer for the "next couple of seasons", with added technical support.</p>
      <p>A team release said: "From now on, the structure will be a satellite team of the Italian manufacturer and will have significant improvements that will allow the team to do a step forward with the goal of being a reference team in the paddock."</p>
      <p>This could be seen as Ducati now publicly trying to prove to Zarco that Avintia would be a solid option for him.</p>

      <p>If Zarco is to join Avintia, it is thought he will replace Karel Abraham, with Tito Rabat penning a two-year extension to his deal earlier in the year.</p>
      <p>Zarco was also linked to Jack Miller's Pramac Ducati, with Miller ousting Danilo Petrucci from the works team.</p>
      <p>However, Petrucci now looks likely to stay at the works Ducati team for next year, with Miller remaining on full factory bike in Pramac colours.</p>
