      <p>Paula Byrne, CEO of the homeless charity Merchants Quay said: "Addiction is destroying the physical and mental health of people, people are dying, and this sadly has become the norm. We must ask ourselves, as a society, are we OK with over 700 drug-related deaths?</p>
      <p>"There needs to be a greater investment in support services for people in addiction. We need more rehabilitation and detox beds."</p>
      <p>Since 2004, the number of drug-related deaths have increased from 431, a jump of over 70%.</p>
      <p>According to the 2017 Ireland Drug Report, around 41% of the those being treated for drug use are heroin users, the most of any other illicit drug in the country.</p>
