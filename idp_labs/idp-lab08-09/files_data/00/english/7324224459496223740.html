      <p>David Tennant has been crowned the UK’s hardest working actor in a study of 100 top television and film stars.</p>
      <p>The former Doctor Who favourite and his Broadchurch co-star Olivia Colman were named the most prolific male and female British acting talent in 2019.</p>
      <p>The study, led by statistician Geoff Ellis, was conducted for BritBox, a new streaming service which presents content from the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5.</p>
      <p>One hundred British TV and film stars who have either won or been nominated for a Bafta or National Television Award in the last decade were analysed on factors such as versatility in acting genres and number of appearances.</p>
      <p>Tennant topped the list for hardest working, followed by Martin Clunes, Sir David Jason, Colman and Dame Julie Walters.</p>
      <p>Rounding off the top 10 are Sir Derek Jacobi, Dame Judi Dench, James Nesbitt, Steve Coogan and Sean Bean.</p>
      <p>Bean was also identified as the actor most likely to have an on-screen death, closely followed by Luther and The Wire star Idris Elba.</p>

      <p>Bean was also ranked as having the most star power, followed by Only Fools And Horses legend Sir David.</p>
      <p>Clunes and Dame Helen Mirren, meanwhile, were declared the most versatile actors.</p>
      <p>Reemah Sakaan, group director for ITV subscription video on-demand, said: “This list highlights a small selection of the top talent in the UK and we’re excited that our fans can enjoy many of the actors’ much-loved classics and more recent work on the service.”</p>
