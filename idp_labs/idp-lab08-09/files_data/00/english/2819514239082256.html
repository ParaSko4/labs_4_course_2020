        <b>New research challenges the long-held idea that, because the brain of human ancestors called <a href="http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species">australopithecines</a> was larger than that of many modern great apes, they were smarter.</b>

      <p>University of Adelaide’s <a href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au/directory/roger.seymour">Professor Roger Seymour</a> and colleagues measured the rate of blood flow to the cognitive part of the brain, based on the size of the holes in the skull that passed the supply arteries.</p>
      <p>The research team calibrated this technique in humans and other mammals and then applied it to 96 great ape skulls and 11 <i>Australopithecus</i> fossil skulls.</p>
      <p>“Our study revealed a higher rate of blood flow to the cognitive part of the brain of living great apes compared to <i>Australopithecus</i>,” Professor Seymour said.</p>
      <p>“The results were unexpected by anthropologists because it has been generally assumed that intelligence is directly related to the size of the brain.”</p>
      <p>“At first, brain size seems reasonable because it is a measure of the number of neurons. On second thought, however, cognition relies not only on the number of neurons, but also on the number of connections between them, called synapses.”</p>
      <p>“These connections govern the flow of information within the brain and greater synaptic activity results in greater information processing.”</p>
      <p>The human brain uses 70% of its energy on synaptic activity, and that amount of energy relies on a proportionately high blood supply to deliver oxygen.</p>
      <p>Although our brain occupies only 2% of our body weight, it uses 15-20% of our energy and requires about 15% of the blood from the heart.</p>
      <p>“The great apes were known to be very intelligent and included the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqJf1mB5PjQ">gorilla Koko</a>, who was taught to communicate with over 1,000 signs, a chimpanzee called <a href="https://www.friendsofwashoe.org/meet/washoe.html">Washoe</a> who learned about 350 signs, and <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/six-talking-apes-48085302/">Kanzi</a>, a bonobo, who not only developed good English comprehension and syntax but also made stone tools,” Professor Seymour said.</p>
      <p>“How does the intelligence of modern great apes stack up against that in our 3 million-year-old relatives, the australopithicines such as <a href="http://www.sci-news.com/othersciences/anthropology/paleoanthropology/lucy-time-trees-04411.html">Lucy</a>? Non-human great apes have smaller or equal sized brains compared to the size indicated by the fossil braincases of <i>Australopithecus</i> species, so Lucy is generally considered to have been smarter.”</p>
      <p>“It is known that the large human brain looks like a scaled-up primate brain in terms of size and neuron number.”</p>
      <p>“However, the study shows that cerebral blood flow rate of human ancestors falls well below the data derived from modern, non-human primates.”</p>
      <p>“Based on the results, it is estimated that blood flow to Koko’s cerebral hemispheres was about twice that of Lucy,” Professor Seymour said.</p>
      <p>“Because blood flow rate might be better measure of information processing capacity than brain size alone, Koko seems to have been smarter.”</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2019.2208">findings</a> were published online in the <i>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</i>.</p>
