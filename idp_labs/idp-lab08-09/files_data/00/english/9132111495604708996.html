      <p>The Ghana Statistical Service has announced that the 2020 Population Census will be completely paperless.</p>
      <p>The GSS says it will deploy a lot of technology for the census.</p>
      <p>Mr Francis Nyarko Larbi from the GSS told Benjamin Akakpo on the Executive Breakfast Show (EBS) on Class 91.3FM, Monday, 18 November that: “It as paperless census; totally paperless.”</p>
      <p>The 2020 Population Census, which is scheduled to take place across the country from Sunday, 15 March 2020, will last for a maximum period of one month.</p>
      <p>The GSS said it will collect data electronically coupled with the use of geospatial technologies recommended by the United Nations Statics Division.</p>
      <p>Mr Nyarko Larbi said: “The maps I mentioned; we’re not going to be using paper maps; all are going to be uploaded onto the electronic devices that we’re going to be using. Our questionnaires are going to be uploaded onto electronic devices, our manuals are all going onto the electronic devices. Therefore, the questionnaire administration is going to be by an electronic device.</p>
      <p>“The processes of the census, the census information, the transfer of the information from the regions or the field onto the head office server are all going to be through the internet and this is what we mean by the involvement of technology in the 2020 census.”</p>
