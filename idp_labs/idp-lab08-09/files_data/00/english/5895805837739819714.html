      </p>
      <p>I’m against using treatments that don’t work. I’m against <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/deception">deceiving</a> patients. I'm for evidence-based medicine. I also think that in some cases, placebos may have a clinically important role. Let me explain with a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3515378">real example</a> that a doctor colleague reported:</p>
      <blockquote>[The patient] was very demanding and difficult to please and claimed to suffer from continuous agony from her ulcer. All of the many mild-to-moderate analgesics were “useless” (according to the patient) and I did not feel opiates were justified, so I asked the advice of my immediate superior. The superior [here referred to as “W.”] saw the patient, discussed her pain and, with a grave face, said he wanted her to try a “completely different sort of treatment.” She agreed. He disappeared into the office, to reappear a few minutes later, walking slowly down the ward and holding in front of him a pair of tweezers which grasped a large, white tablet, the size of [a] half dollar. As he came nearer, it became clear (to me, at least) that the tablet was none other than effervescent vitamin C.</blockquote>
      <p>Another colleague (in private) admitted to having given a saltwater injection to a <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/opioids">morphine</a> addict. He had good reason to believe that the pain the addict complained of was a ruse, so injected him with saline, and it worked. In the UK, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0058247">97% of general practitioners</a> admitted to having used placebos in clinical practice at least once. Doctors in other countries <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20178561">do it almost as much</a>. Doctors do this because they believe it helps.</p>
      <p>An apparent problem is that placebos seem to involve lying to a patient, by telling them that the placebo is something <i>real</i>. But new-ish research shows that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28452193">placebos don’t require deception</a>. One trial of <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0015591"><i>open-label</i> placebos for irritable bowel syndrome</a> (IBS) found that placebos worked even when the patient was told they were placebos. One of the patients in the trial was called <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/22/knew-they-were-sugar-pills-felt-fantastic-rise-open-label-placebos">Linda Buanonno</a>. Her IBS was so bad that she often couldn’t leave the house. The placebos helped. Then, at the end of the trial, she had no more placebos and her IBS got worse. She went to the pharmacist to get more and the pharmacist replied that it would be unethical to do so.</p>

      <p>Here's how placebos might play a clinically important role. According to my GP colleagues, many patients with colds or flu demand a pill. Sometimes overworked GPs cave in and prescribe antibiotics. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://amr-review.org/">‘antibiotic apocalypse’ kills an estimated 700,000 people every</a> year due to antibiotic-resistant superbugs. Instead of giving antibiotics for a viral infection, a doctor might be able to offer an <i>open label placebo.</i> Adopting a similar strategy to the ones used in the trials of these ‘non-deceptive’ placebos, a doctor might say:</p>
      <blockquote>This placebo remedy might help you. It does not contain any ‘active’ <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/psychopharmacology">medication</a>, but it might help you due to some, mind-body, self-healing processes. It’s safer than antibiotics for your condition. Would you be willing to try it? If your symptoms get worse, or you are not better within a week, please get in touch.</blockquote>
      <p>Mild <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/depression">depression</a> and mild pain are other areas where open-label placebos could help. Antidepressant drugs <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050045">barely outperform placebos for mild depression</a>, yet have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5667359/">side effects</a>, and the same goes for common <a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD012087/BACK_non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory-drugs-chronic-low-back-pain">painkillers for chronic back pain</a>. Using non-deceptive placebos where there is no conventional treatment seems acceptable and less harmful than the standard practice of overprescribing antibiotics, painkillers, and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/ssris">antidepressants</a>. It might even help curb the opioid crisis.</p>
      <p>There are <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(07)61706-1/abstract">potential problems</a> with prescribing open-label placebos. It might undermine the medical profession (people might always wonder whether a treatment was a placebo every time they visited their doctor), it could encourage a pill-popping culture, and patients who <a href="https://jme.bmj.com/content/43/12/867">don't understand placebos</a> might be deceived. These real concerns need evidence-based answers. We need a trial that investigates whether open-label placebos are cost-effective and how they affect trust in and use of medicine. Such trials would be expensive-all trials are-but conceptually simple.</p>
      <p>A related worry is that supporting open-label placebos could open the door to 'anything goes'. Homeopathy is a prime example of this. Conventional doctors have been arguing against homeopathy for over 150 years with sound arguments. Mainly, the theory explaining how homeopathy works (that vanishingly small doses can cure) doesn't make sense. Yet, the debate rages on with positions remaining rigid: believers still believe, and skeptics still doubt. Attempts to resolve the debate for good employ placebo-controlled trials. It turns out that the most rigorous studies show that <a href="https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2016/02/16/paul-glasziou-still-no-evidence-for-homeopathy/">homeopathy doesn’t outperform placebo</a>. But the point of this article is: that’s not the point. Homeopathy might be a cost-effective safe option for the same conditions as open-label placebos. To prevent misunderstanding: homeopathy (or any treatment, for that matter) should not be used when we know there is a more effective option. If someone gets a 3rd-degree burn, they need a burn unit, not homeopathy. The 150-year-old debate about homeopathy needs relevant evidence more than it needs more of the same stale debate.</p>
      <blockquote>To ban homeopathy would be an over-reaction, as placebos could have a clinical role. However, whether the <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/placebo">placebo effect</a> is best harnessed by homeopaths will remain questionable until these ethical issues and side-effects have been addressed-Ben Goldacre</blockquote>
      <p>Arch skeptic <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(07)61706-1/abstract">Ben Goldacre knows about the trials showing that homeopathy doesn't outperform placebos in large trials</a>. Yet, he claims: "To ban homeopathy would be an over-reaction, as placebos could have a clinical role. However, whether the placebo effect is best harnessed by homeopaths will remain questionable until these ethical issues and side-effects have been addressed." Just so. Let's put an evidence-based stop to the newer debate about the <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/ethics-and-morality">ethics</a> of placebos and the 150 debate about homeopathy.</p>
