      <h1>Su’a Cravens safe after alarming social media posts</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/matthew-paras/" target="_blank">Matthew Paras</a></address>
      <p>Su’a <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cravens/">Cravens</a> is safe after the former Redskins safety posted an alarming series of social media posts, according to a pair of former teammates. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/will-blackmon/">Will Blackmon</a>, who played with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cravens/">Cravens</a> in 2016, gave an update on <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cravens/">Cravens</a> early Monday morning. Linebacker Will Compton also seemingly shared an update on <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cravens/">Cravens</a> as well, saying “All is okay. No need to worry anymore. He is safe and with family.”</p>
      <p>Late Sunday, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cravens/">Cravens</a> posted a number of messages that caused people to worry, including one that said, “If these are my last days, I want to say I love you and I always will. God I leave the rest up to you” and another that said “Goodbye” and included a heart emoji. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cravens/">Cravens</a> then wiped the content on all his social media accounts.</p>

        <p>The Redskins drafted <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cravens/">Cravens</a> out of USC in the second round of the 2016 draft. The 24-year-old left the team in 2017 prior to the start of the season and was shutdown for the year when he tried to return weeks later, leading to the Redskins trading him the following spring. </p>
