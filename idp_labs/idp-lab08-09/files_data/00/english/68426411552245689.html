      <p>Deforestation in Brazil’s Amazon rain forest rose to its highest in over a decade this year, government data on Monday showed, confirming a sharp rise under the leadership of right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro.</p>
      <p>Brazil’s INPE space research agency said deforestation reached 9,762 square kilometres, up 29.5 per cent, for the 12 months through July 2019.</p>
      <p>That’s the worst level of deforestation since 2008, heaping further pressure on the environmental policy of Bolsonaro who favours developing the Amazon region economically.</p>
      <p>Environment Minister Ricardo Salles told reporters in a briefing on the figures that Brazil would roll out a series of measures to counter the rising deforestation, including stepping up enforcement efforts assisted by high-resolution satellite imaging.</p>
      <p>Salles said he would meet with governors of Amazon states on Wednesday to further discuss tactics to counter deforestation, adding that the figures show a new strategy was needed and that sustainable economic opportunities must be developed in the region.</p>
      <p>The Amazon is the world’s largest tropical rain forest and is considered key to the fight against climate change because of the vast amounts of carbon dioxide it absorbs.</p>
