        <b>Apple Watch</b>
      </p>
      <p>Since its launch in Spring 2015, Apple’s smart timepiece has been ahead of its rivals pretty consistently. The latest model, Apple Watch Series 5, arrived in September this year and is the best yet, with a display that’s always-on, a compass and the new, spiffy design first seen in Fall 2018 when the Apple Watch Series 4 appeared. </p>
      <p>As it’s so new, Series 5 is hard to find at reduced prices, though not impossible and further reductions are expected. Series 4 has been discontinued and, unless the always-on display is what you want, may be the best choice for bargain hunters. After all, it has the same chip as the Series 5 and a near-identical design. </p>
      <p>Then there’s Series 3. First released in Fall 2017, it has a great design, just not quite as gorgeous as the models that followed. Apple recently reduced the price pretty aggressively – it’s now $199 and up – but there are still even better bargains to be had.</p>
      <p>Apple Watches come in two sizes. For Series 3, these were 38mm and 42mm, and for Series 4 and 5 there was a slight adjustment to 40mm and 44mm sizes. Choosing the size you prefer is your first task. </p>
      <p>Then, do you want a model with GPS and wi-fi connectivity only or GPS plus cellular, so you can make phone calls direct from your wrist, for instance, even if your phone is at home? Not every model has this option – Series 3 used to but is now only available as wi-fi only.</p>
      <p>Your third choice is the look of the Watch. There are several metal finishes to the cases: aluminum, stainless steel and in Series 5 only, titanium or ceramic finishes. Aluminum comes in several shades, as do stainless steel and titanium. </p>
      <p>Oh, and one more thing, there are two special editions: Apple Watch Nike+, which is the same price as a regular Apple Watch, and Apple Watch Hermes, which is noticeably pricier. </p>
      <p>Enough introduction. You can read my review of Apple Watch Series 5 <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2019/09/30/apple-watch-series-5-the-definitive-review-a-subtle-but-game-changing-upgrade/#353315202b05">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Here’s the lowdown on the best bargains announced so far. </p>

        <i>Apple Watch at Amazon</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Series 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>Amazon has the 40mm GPS Series 5 for $384 instead of $399, a $15 saving, or the 44mm size for $414 instead of $429, also $15 off. Buy 40mm <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B07XR5TRSZ/ref=sr_1_3?crid=ZQAZT4HDG462&amp;keywords=apple+watch+series+5+gps+40mm&amp;qid=1574106736&amp;sprefix=apple+watch+series+5+gps+%2Caps%2C255&amp;sr=8-3">here</a> and 44mm <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-GPS-44mm-Aluminum/dp/B07XRBF5ZP/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=apple%2Bwatch%2Bseries%2B5&amp;qid=1574106660&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExNFFJNkpWTUJCWkhDJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNzc3OTYzTTc5QUw5QUUzUjgzJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA5NjEzNDcyVTFFQkRSQzJOSTYzJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ&amp;th=1">here</a>. Several color choices.</p>
      <p>A slightly bigger discount, $40 is to be found on the 40mm version with cellular, that’s $459, though it’s back to the more modest $15 reduction on the 44mm Watch, that’s $514, both in aluminum. Buy 40mm <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-GPS-Cellular-40mm/dp/B07XQYCKC4/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=apple+watch+series+5+gps+cellular+40mm&amp;qid=1574106789&amp;sr=8-3">here</a> and 44mm <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-GPS-Cellular-44mm/dp/B07XR6GNCK/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=apple+watch+series+5+gps+cellular+44mm&amp;qid=1574106884&amp;sr=8-3">here</a>.</p>
      <p>If you want stainless-steel, the Stainless Steel Watch with GPS + Cellular in Space Black – arguably the most attractive finish ever – has $80 off in 44mm size only. Buy it <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-GPS-Cellular-44mm/dp/B07XR5K7TG/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Apple%2BWatch%2BSeries%2B5%2B(GPS%2B%2B%2BCellular%2C%2B44mm)%2B-%2BSpace%2BBlack&amp;qid=1574107098&amp;sr=8-1&amp;th=1">here</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Series 4</b>
      </p>
      <p>Amazon has bigger discounts on Apple Watch Series 4. For example, you can buy the 44mm Space Gray aluminum with GPS only for $329, that’s $100 off the previous $429 price. Available <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-GPS-44mm-Space-Aluminium/dp/B07K3HLMTF/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=Apple%2BWatch%2BSeries%2B5%2B(GPS%2B%2B%2BCellular%2C%2B44mm)%2B-%2BSpace%2BBlack&amp;qid=1574107098&amp;sr=8-5&amp;th=1">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Best of all? Series 4 GPS + Cellular with Space Black stainless-steel casing, reduced from $749 to $399, that’s $350 off! Buy it <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-GPS-Cellular-44mm-Stainless/dp/B07HR9XFF3/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=Apple+Watch+Series+5+%28GPS+%2B+Cellular%2C+44mm%29+-+Space+Black&amp;qid=1574107098&amp;sr=8-2">here</a>. It’s also available ins the smaller 40mm size for the same price, $399, which means it’s $300 off the previous $699 price. You can buy it <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-GPS-Cellular-40mm-Stainless/dp/B07J6SPFK5/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=Apple+Watch+Series+4+%28GPS+%2B+Cellular%2C+40mm%29+-+Space+Black&amp;qid=1574107610&amp;sr=8-4">here</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Series 3</b>
      </p>
      <p>A snap at its full retail price, Amazon has another $30 off, so $169.99 for the 38mm case, available <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K39FRSL/ref=fs_a_w_5">here</a>, though no reduction currently on the 44mm version (available for $229, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K387Y7K/ref=fs_a_w_5?th=1">here</a>).</p>
      <p>Things are the other way round when you add cellular. The 38mm version is at full price, $299, but the larger 42mm model is actually cheaper thanks to a $64.01 discount that reduces the price from $329 to $264.99. Buy it <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K3BJRDR/ref=fs_a_w_4?th=1">here</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <i>Apple Watch at B&amp;H</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Series 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>Like Amazon, there’s a $15 discount on Series 5 aluminum GPS only. That’s $384 for 40mm – buy it <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1506017-REG/apple_mwv72ll_a_watch_5_gps_40mm.html">here</a> – or $414 for 44mm – available <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1506021-REG/apple_mwvf2ll_a_watch_5_gps_44mm.html">here</a>. Check the site for more colors and variants such as Nike+. Same $15 off on the GPS + Cellular watches. That’s $484 for the gold aluminum with pink sand sport band, available <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1506032-REG/apple_mwwp2ll_a_watch_5_gps.html">here</a>.</p>
      <p>However, if you like Space Gray aluminum the discount is $40, that is, it’s on sale for $459, available <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1506033-REG/apple_mwwq2ll_a_watch_5_gps.html">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Add cellular and the 44mm version in Space Gray costs $514, a discount of, that’s right, $15. You can buy it <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1506024-REG/apple_mww12ll_a_watch_5_gps.html">here</a>. The discount isn’t much bigger on stainless steel, either. In Space Black, the 44mm version with GPS + Cellular is $669 instead of $699 – a $30 saving. It’s <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1506029-REG/apple_mww72ll_a_watch_5_gps.html">here</a>. The same watch with the classy Milanese Loop band has a marginally better saving, $50, knocking the price down from $799 to $749. Available <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1506030-REG/apple_mww82ll_a_watch_5_gps.html">here</a>, in regular stainless steel <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1506026-REG/apple_mww32ll_a_watch_5_gps.html">here</a> or in gold stainless steel for the same price <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1506028-REG/apple_mww62ll_a_watch_5_gps.html">here</a>. Smaller wrists may prefer the 40mm version which in gold stainless steel with that eye-catching gold Milanese Loop is also $50 off, at $699, <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1506037-REG/apple_mwwv2ll_a_watch_5_gps.html">here</a>. Same price applies for regular-color stainless steel in 40mm: $699, available <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1506035-REG/apple_mwwt2ll_a_watch_5_gps.html">here</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Series 4</b>
      </p>
      <p>Right now, the discounts are pretty small, between $10 and $30, so not recommended. If you want to check them out, B&amp;H’s Series 4 page is <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/search?Ntt=apple%20watch%20series%204&amp;N=0&amp;InitialSearch=yes&amp;sts=ma&amp;Top+Nav-Search=">here</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Series 3</b>
      </p>
      <p>Models of Series 3 with GPS only are on sale for full price, but there are savings on the Series 3 with GPS + Cellular. Still, they tend to really only be around $30 – in some cases the original list price was higher than the current prices which gives the impression of bigger discounts. </p>
