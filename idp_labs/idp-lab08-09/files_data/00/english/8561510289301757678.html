      <h1>Elon Musk Tears Into NASA for Pricey Boeing Launches</h1>

      <h3>Not Right</h3>
      <p>On Thursday, NASA’s inspector general released a <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/ticket-space-boeing-more-expensive-spacex">report</a> about the Commercial Crew Program, an initiative through which NASA has contracted both Boeing and SpaceX to develop systems to transport astronauts to the International Space Station.</p>
      <p>According to that report, Boeing’s solution will end up costing about $90 million per astronaut per trip, while SpaceX’s will cost just $55 million — and that “doesn’t seem right” <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1195143158486765568">to SpaceX CEO Elon Musk</a>.</p>
      <h3>Same Service</h3>
      <p>Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1195143158486765568">tweeted</a> his opinion on the price discrepancy in response to an <i>Ars Technica</i> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/11/nasa-report-finds-boeing-seat-prices-are-60-higher-than-spacex/?utm_brand=arstechnica&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;utm_medium=social">story</a> focused on the high cost of ISS seat prices through Boeing compared to SpaceX.</p>
      <p>Musk went on to note in a <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1195143726504370176">follow-up tweet</a> that he’s specifically calling into question the fairness of Boeing getting “so much more” money from NASA for providing the “same thing” as SpaceX.</p>
      <h3>Bad Math</h3>
      <p>The purpose of the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/specials/ccp-press-kit/main.html">Commercial Crew Program</a> is to end NASA’s reliance on Roscosmos, Russia’s space agency, for transporting astronauts to the ISS.</p>
      <p>Since 2017, those trips have cost NASA an average of $79.7 million per astronaut per flight, meaning using Boeing’s transportation “solution” in lieu of Russia’s will actually end up costing NASA more — and fairness to SpaceX aside, that doesn’t make much fiscal sense for an agency that’s already <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/congress-kill-2024-moon-mission">struggling to fund</a> its planned missions.</p>
