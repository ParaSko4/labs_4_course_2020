      <p>Have you heard of Dollar Shave Club?It sells razors and other grooming products for men.</p>
      <p>In just five years, it has grown into a $1 billion company and one of the biggest “personal care” brands in America… and it’s now threatening giants like Gillette and Schick.</p>
      <p>You might be surprised to learn the company pulled this off without selling a single product in a physical store.</p>
      <p>You can’t buy its razors or aftershave in Walmart, Target, Costco, or anywhere else in the “real world.” It only sells its products on the internet.</p>
      <p>Now here’s the truly shocking thing...</p>
      <p>It doesn’t sell products on Amazon, either!</p>
      <p>More and more companies are dumping not only retail stores but also Amazon to sell their products online. And there’s an invisible tech giant driving this trend.</p>
      <p>It’s already the second-biggest shopping company on earth, <a href="http://www.riskhedge.com/go/v3c8j7/for">nipping at Amazon’s heels</a>.</p>
      <p>Today one in three Americans buy from this company without knowing it. Even Tesla sells electric cars through it!</p>
      <p>I’ll share the stock with you in a minute. First, let me explain what <a href="http://www.riskhedge.com/go/v3c8jb/for">the <i>massive</i> disruption</a> it’s powering...</p>
      <h3>The Disappearing Middleman</h3>
      <p>The secret of Dollar Shave Club is very simple. It ditched the middleman and sold its razors directly to the customer.</p>
      <p>The only way to buy its stuff is to go to its website and place an order. It’s called direct selling online.</p>
      <p>Let me show you what a GIGANTIC trend it is. The chart below shows the growth of online sales vs. retail sales in America… across some of the most popular product categories:</p>

      <p>As you can see, companies are bypassing brick-and-mortar stores across the board and selling stuff directly to the customer online.</p>
      <p>Today, direct sales make up just 15% of all sales in America… BUT they are growing 500% faster than retail sales, according to Digital Commerce 360. Meanwhile, retail is stalling.</p>
      <p>While thousands of retail stores are closing down, online stores are springing up like mushrooms after the rain.</p>
      <p>More than half of all new small businesses are either exclusively online or sell most of their stuff there, according to <i>Forbes</i>.</p>
      <p>That’s a paradigm shift in the way the world’s <b>$26 trillion</b> commerce machine runs… And companies that power this trend are set to rake in billions of dollars.</p>
      <h3>Selling Stuff Online Was a Nasty Business Not So Long Ago…</h3>
      <p>While it sounds like it’s all sunshine and roses, selling online can be daunting.</p>
      <p>You have to build a website…rent a server to run your website on… collect payments… all while making sure everything is secure and in compliance with regulations.</p>
      <p>A basic online store could set you back as much as $50,000. But it’s not just that.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.riskhedge.com/go/v3c8jf/for">You have to ship your products</a>, accept returns… you name it. I can go on and on, but the thing is it’s a costly business.</p>
      <p>As you may know, Amazon sells not only its stuff but also products from third-party sellers. And not long ago, the only way for small businesses to sell online was to partner with Amazon.</p>
      <p>But everything recently changed.</p>
      <h3>The Amazon of Small Business</h3>
      <p>If you bought stuff from an online store other than Amazon, chances are it was powered by Shopify (SHOP).</p>
      <p>Founded in 2004, Shopify has become a “storefront” for small businesses and mom and pop stores that sell stuff online.</p>
      <p>Unlike Amazon, which simply lists your products on its marketplace, Shopify helps you sell your own products on YOUR OWN website.</p>
      <p>Although you wouldn't know it from looking at the website, most online stores are powered by Shopify.</p>
      <p>Here’s how it works…</p>
      <p>The company offers a simple tool with which anyone can set up a custom online store for as little as $29/month…</p>
      <p>Shopify can even fulfill your orders, which means it holds your inventory at its warehouses and ships your products.</p>
      <p>You don’t have to maintain software or servers. You don’t need to hire expensive programmers or be into coding yourself. You don’t have to bother with shipping.</p>
      <p>In minutes, you can have a full-fledged online store that’s running on autopilot under your business name… just like Amazon.</p>
      <p>It’s like getting a fully furnished retail store with trained sales clerks… all for a few bucks. You just put your products on the shelves, hang a storefront sign, lean back and watch sales come in.</p>
      <h3>Shopify Is the Invisible Online Shopping Giant</h3>
      <p>Since 2015, Shopify stock shot up over 1,000%...</p>

      <p>The stock grew so fast that management forbid employees to check the company’s stock price at work.</p>
      <p>In 2012, Shopify had just 42,000 merchants. Today, more than 1,000,000 businesses around the globe have set up an online store with Shopify.</p>
      <p>That’s almost as many as all retail stores in the entire US, according to the National Retail Federation.</p>
      <p>In 2016, one in three Americans bought from a Shopify-powered store.</p>
      <p>Shopify has recently topped online giant eBay to become the second-largest online shopping player on earth… right behind Amazon. Over $82 billion worth of goods were sold through this company.</p>
      <p>And it’s just the beginning….</p>
      <h3>Shopify Could Double in the Next Few Years</h3>
      <p>Online retail is already a massive $3.5 trillion industry today, according to Statista. But we are just in the early innings of the tsunami that will hit retail in the coming years.</p>
      <p>By 2022, online sales will make up 20% of total retail sales, up 5% from today.</p>
      <p>Five percent doesn’t sound much, but that will add a whopping $2.2 billion worth of sales, according to eMarketer.</p>
      <p>That means the industry will almost double in just as little as three years.</p>
      <p>If Shopify keeps growing at its current pace, I wouldn’t be surprised to see it double its sales by 2022.</p>
      <p>I have to warn you, though.</p>
      <p>The company has skyrocketed 1,000% in the past years. That’s a tremendous gain. It’s not uncommon for such stocks to take a breather and slip double digits.</p>
      <p>For now, I’d recommend putting a small position in this stock and keeping a close eye on it.</p>
