      <h1>ACCC Calls On Facebook And Google To Pay For News</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.channelnews.com.au/author/computer-daily-news/" target="_blank">Computer Daily News</a></address>
      <p>Google and Facebook have been engaged in a process of “atomising” media news as they attempt to become the source of all news, Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission chairman Rod Sims has told a Law Society conference</p>
      <p>“That atomisation makes it very hard for news companies to monetise their product,” he said.</p>
      <p>Sims said the behaviour of the tech giants is eroding legitimate news organisations because exclusive news reports are being quickly displaced online by slightly altered versions of the same story.</p>
      <p>To tackle the issue, Sims is calling on the Morrison Government to see that the IT companies be subject to a bargaining code with news organisations.</p>
      <p>He called on the Government to accept the ACCC’s call to govern relations between the tech giants and the news media.</p>
      <p>“For us, this is all about the future of journalism,” he said.</p>
