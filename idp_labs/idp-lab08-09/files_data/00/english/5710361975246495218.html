      <h1>Lawmakers urge U.S. government to tighten export controls amid China threat: document</h1>

      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer and Republican Senator Tom Cotton on Monday in a letter urged the U.S. government to swiftly issue rules to make it harder to export sophisticated technologies to China that Beijing can use to boost its military.</p>
      <p>The letter, seen by Reuters, was addressed to Secretary Wilbur Ross of the Commerce Department, which was tasked by a 2018 law with drafting regulations to toughen export controls for cutting edge technologies.</p>
      <p>To launch the process, the Commerce Department in November 2018 sought public comment on how best to design so-called emerging technology rules, which could cover anything from artificial intelligence to biotechnology.</p>
      <p>A year later, however, the agency has not proposed any rules and has not yet sought input on how to regulate exports of so-called "foundational technologies," those needed to produce cutting edge goods.</p>
      <p>"We understand the technical challenges of evaluating cutting-edge technologies," Schumer and Cotton wrote, "but it is imperative that the department act expeditiously to develop guidance around these technologies to prevent them from being exported to our military competitors."</p>
      <p>The Commerce Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>The letter is part of a growing chorus of frustration directed at the agency at the heart of the U.S. technology battle with China, over delayed measures to stymie China's technological advance.</p>
      <p>U.S. Representative Michael McCaul, ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, penned a letter to Ross last month calling for swifter action on the rules, arguing that China is "sprinting ahead" in the meantime.</p>
      <p>In their letter, Schumer and Cotton said the delays come as China aims to acquire American technology with both military and civilian uses - items that are easier to acquire due to some harmless applications but that can be used in warfare and defense.</p>
      <p>"This strategy of 'Military-Civil Fusion' is deeply concerning to Congress, as it leads to American businesses unwittingly exporting sensitive technology to our primary military competitor," they wrote, asking the department to provide an update on the status of the rule-making efforts.</p>
      <p>The Commerce Department has also missed an October deadline to lay out rules to protect the telecoms supply chain from national security threats.</p>
      <p>Speaking at an event last month, Commerce official Eileen Albanese said the telecoms supply chain rules were under review. She also said the department would propose emerging-technology measures shortly and that the agency hoped to seek comment before proposing a rule for foundational technology before the end of the year.</p>
