      <p>The striker even left the stadium before the Juventus v Milan match ended. <b>This caused some discomfort in the squad</b>. In Italy, they spoke of a meeting between Ronaldo and the board, although the the event wasn't given too much importance.</p>
      <p>To iron out the rough edges,<b> Cristiano will invite his teammates to a good restaurant </b>to celebrate the definitive peace after the match against Atalanta, who Juventus play on Saturday. On Wednesday, after playing with Portugal, he will train with his teammates.</p>
