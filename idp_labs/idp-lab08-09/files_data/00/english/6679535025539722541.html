      <h2>Strategic road was blocked for three days after a massive landslide</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:04:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 00:04</time> by <a rel="author">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Over 4,500 vehicles, mostly trucks carrying apples from Kashmir, resumed their onward journey by Sunday afternoon as the Jammu-Srinagar national highway was reopened for traffic three days after being blocked by a massive landslide, officials said.</p>
      <p>The 270-km strategic highway, the only all-weather road linking Kashmir with rest of the country, was cleared of debris brought in by the landslide near Digdole around 3 p.m. on Saturday, a traffic department official said.</p>
      <p>However, intermittent shooting stones, due to rain, from the hillocks overlooking the highway at several places including Digdole, Maroog and Panthiyal disrupted free flow of traffic.</p>
      <h3>Preference to trucks</h3>
      <p>With improvement in weather, vehicles were allowed to ply from both the sides, while preference was given to stranded Jammu-bound trucks carrying apples from Kashmir to the outside markets.</p>
      <p>“So far, over 3,700 trucks and 800 light motor vehicles crossed the Jawahar Tunnel, the gateway of Kashmir,” the official said adding Kashmir-bound trucks, which are stranded at various places on the highway, are likely to be allowed to move towards their destinations later in the day.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Mughal Road which connects the border districts of Poonch and Rajouri in Jammu region with Shopian district in south Kashmir remained closed for the 12th day on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The road, which usually remains closed during the winter months, was closed on November 6 after high altitude areas including Pir Ki Gali experienced the first major snowfall of the season.</p>
      <p>Officials said a 37-km stretch of the road, from Bufliaz to Mansar morh, was cleared, while work on the seven-km stretch from Mansar morh towards Shopian is underway.</p>
      <p>The road has become slippery after the recent snowfall, delaying its reopening, they said.</p>
