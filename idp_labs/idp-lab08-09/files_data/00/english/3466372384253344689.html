      <p>It was a marked change from the earlier uniform in which they wore a bandhgala and a safa.</p>
      <p>The marshals wore a blue uniform with a military-style peak cap and stripes on shoulders. In summers, the marshals are likely to wear white uniforms which have a resemblance to the uniform of the Indian Navy.</p>
      <p>Four marshals are always on duty among the pool of marshals when the House is in session.</p>
      <p>Former army chief General V P Malik disagreed with the changes and expressed his views in a tweet.</p>
      <p>"Copying and wearing of military uniforms by non-military personnel is illegal and a security hazard," he said and hoped that early action will be taken in the matter.</p>
