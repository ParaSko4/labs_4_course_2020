      <p>TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) - Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa has had surgery on his right hip.</p>
      <p>Alabama team surgeon Dr. Lyle Cain said Monday the procedure in Houston was successful. Cain described Tagovailoa’s prognosis as “excellent” and reiterated that he is expected to make a full recovery.</p>
      <p>He says Tagovailoa will return to Tuscaloosa “in the next several days” to begin the rehab process.</p>
      <p>The fifth-ranked Crimson Tide’s star, a potential top pick in April’s NFL draft, was injured while being dragged down by two defenders late in the first half of Saturday’s 38-7 win over Mississippi State.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa has been projected as a potential No. 1 overall NFL draft pick. The junior had Alabama in playoff contention again and has already set the school record for total touchdowns, with 87 passing and nine rushing.</p>
