      <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on November 18, said in the Rajya Sabha that people's hearts can be won by political parties even without rushing to the Well of the House to register their protest on various issues.</p>
      <p>He was addressing the House during a special discussion marking the 250th sessions of the Rajya Sabha.</p>
      <p>PM Modi said that Sharad Pawar’s Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Naveen Patnaik’s Biju Janata Dal (BJD) have wonderfully adhered to parliamentary norms by not entering the Well of the House.</p>
