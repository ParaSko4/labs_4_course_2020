      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - Sacramento guard Buddy Hield has been fined $25,000 by the NBA for kicking the ball into the stands following the Kings’ victory over Boston.</p>
      <p>The ball bounced toward midcourt after Marcus Smart’s potential winning shot bounced off the rim Sunday. Hield chased it down and kicked it into the crowd.</p>
      <p>The penalty was announced Monday by Kiki VanDeWeghe, the NBA’s executive vice president of basketball operations.</p>
      <p>Hield scored a season-high 35 points in Sacramento’s 100-99 victory that snapped the Celtics’ 10-game winning streak.</p>
