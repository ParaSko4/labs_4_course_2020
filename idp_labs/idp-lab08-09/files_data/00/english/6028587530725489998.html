      <p>“Trees are sanctuaries. Whoever knows how to speak to them—whoever knows how to listen to them—can learn the truth. They do not preach learning and precepts; they preach, undeterred by particulars, the ancient law of life.” — Hermann Hesse, "Wandering"Typically, when we talk about teams, we think in terms of competition. Even though teams are essentially built to work together toward a common goal, the ultimate goal is usually to defeat a specific challenge — or even another team. With an eye toward victory, claiming a stake or a territory, the team employs strategies that will undoubtedly lead to a level-up situation. As humans, we are trained to see, conquer and celebrate our wins.</p>
      <p>But things work very differently in the forest. In this lush world, the strong band together to send nutrients and energy to weaker members — and everything is done for the betterment of the whole. So, instead of looking around to assess our teams, maybe it would be a better idea to simply look up. Way up. What can we humans learn from the teamwork of trees?</p>
      <p>For starters, let’s look at the root system: This is how trees communicate with each other and how they help each other <i>without passing judgment</i>. Isn’t that beautiful? They support each other and share nutrients without saying, “Well, that tree is inferior, so let’s not send any nutrients over there.” Or, “That tree is the outlier, so let’s not include it in our group.” They don’t say things like that. They communicate purely by feel and with only one ulterior motive: that we are stronger together.</p>
      <p>Did you know that California redwoods, despite being so tall, have very <a href="https://www.livescience.com/39461-sequoias-redwood-trees.html">shallow root systems</a>, often only five or six feet deep? They spread out laterally and interlock with the other root systems of the surrounding trees; this is what gives them the strength to stand upright and not fall over.</p>
      <p>Did you also know that by dispensing a moist <a href="http://scienceandthesea.org/program/201012/redwoods-and-fog">fog</a> equal to 500 gallons of water over the other trees and forest plants every day, redwoods produce a self-contained rainforest — one that nourishes not only the flora and fauna but also offers benefits to humankind?</p>
      <p>That means that whatever happens to those trees happens to the whole ecosystem, because they are interdependent on each other — and this is why redwoods only grow in pairs.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Power Of Interconnectedness</b>
      </p>
      <p>Whether redwoods at 350 feet high or aspen groves with interconnected roots, trees get teamwork right. Through the power of interconnectedness, trees know what it sometimes takes humans years to figure out: We can’t do things alone; simply, we are stronger together. In the forest, the whole is always much bigger than the parts — and nothing can ever grow alone.</p>
      <p>What else do trees teach us about teamwork?</p>
      <p><b>1. There is strength in support.</b> In the forest, vulnerability is never seen as a weakness, but rather an opportunity to share nutrients. It is an intradependent — not a codependent — system. But what does it really mean to support the differences that exist in teams around strength and weaknesses versus empowering the strong to get stronger at the potential elimination of the weak? This is actually a very fundamental question.</p>
      <p><b>2. We must practice being-ness.</b> Trees just are — and they are without judgment. They teach us to always assume positive intent, to be authentic with each other and, in that, connect our roots for a stronger foundation. Think about it: What does practicing nonjudgment really mean for your organization? How can it be presented as a value and expressed in daily communications?</p>
      <p><b>3. What we feed on matters.</b> Systems must be created with the right nutrients for teams to thrive. So, if a tree becomes vulnerable because of a storm, lack of nutrients or lightning strikes, the other trees bring life force to the one that is weak. The vulnerable tree has amplified the connection, and frankly, it’s the duty of the grove or the team to give life force back to that weak link as a way to make the team even stronger. Because this process is so nonjudgmental, vulnerability is not seen or felt as a weakness but rather as a strength. Otherwise, why would the other trees give their nutrients to that one weak link, especially if it might die? Nature only does things on purpose.</p>
      <p><b>4. Trust is a given and should be in every team’s DNA.</b> All team members need to have safety in being vulnerable while leaning on each other versus jockeying for leadership or successor positions. How do we create teams that are going to have the right conversations and develop adequate emotional intelligence to learn that it is completely OK to depend on each other and support one another — including the weakest link?</p>
      <p><b>5. Sometimes you need to burn it all down and start over.</b> Often, particularly in cases of controlled burning, the black-ash process of rejuvenation leads to greener, stronger trees. This is how the grass grows back and how your team can bounce back from a tough challenge or “storm.”</p>
      <p><b>6. Foster the seeds of possibility.</b> Every time you start over with a team, you have the opportunity to cocreate something new. Become good stewards of your forest by feeding and supporting each other. Encourage <i>all</i> ideas to be expressed, especially ones that feel uncomfortable or provocative. Protect the seeds, and help them to grow. Give them the right environment, and feed them well.</p>
      <p>Providing safety for all stakeholders to fully participate in a workplace where they can live, grow and thrive is a critical element for any conscious company. In learning how to listen to everyone’s needs so that we can create safe havens for each other while constantly recalibrating and reinvesting in our own ecosystems, we can join roots and collectively rise toward our highest potential. What could be a bigger win than that?</p>
