      <p>‘Shramik Bandu’, an exclusive facilitation centre for migrant labourers, will start functioning near Railway Station Link Road here on Monday. Minister for Excise and Labour T.P. Ramakrishnan will open the facility, which was set up by the Labour Department.</p>
      <p>The services of two trained personnel who are proficient in Hindi and Bengali will be used to coordinate the activities of the centre.</p>
      <p>It will also coordinate the distribution of health insurance cards to migrant workers under the State government’s ‘Awaz’ scheme. Labour Department officials said it was the first such centre in the Malabar region. Similar centres are functional in Ernakulam and Thiruvananthapuram districts, and they have been found very successful in catering to the needs of the migrant population, they added.</p>
      <h3>Welfare projects</h3>
      <p>The new facilitation centre is expected to take up various migrant labour welfare projects with the government.</p>
      <p>According to Labour Department officials, the services of the centre will be used in such a way to cover maximum number of migrant labourers under the Awaz insurance scheme on the day of their arrival at the city. So far, around 33,000 migrant labourers have secured Awaz cards in Kozhikode district.</p>
      <p>Campaign is also under way to raise the number by enrolling 7,000 more labourers, they said.</p>
