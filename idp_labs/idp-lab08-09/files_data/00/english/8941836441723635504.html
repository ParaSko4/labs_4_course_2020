      <p>SEATTLE (AP) - Seattle Children’s Hospital said Monday it believes a mold outbreak that has sickened seven patients, one fatally, since summer 2018 is linked to mold-related infections dating back nearly two decades.</p>
      <p>Five children died from infections linked to Aspergillus mold in operating rooms at Children’s from 2001 to 2014, and two others became ill, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeff-sperring/">Dr. Jeff Sperring</a>, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/seattle-childrens-hospital/">hospital</a>’s chief executive, said in a written statement.</p>
      <p>Those cases were thought at the time to be isolated, but officials now believe they and the more recent infections are all linked to inadequate air filtration, he said.</p>
      <p>“Looking back, we should have recognized these connections sooner,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeff-sperring/">Sperring</a> said. “As CEO, I hold myself – and Seattle Children’s – to a higher standard.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeff-sperring/">Sperring</a> closed most operating rooms at Children’s main campus after Nov. 10, when air tests detected Aspergillus, a common mold that can pose a severe danger to people with weakened immune systems or lung disease.</p>

      <p>He said they will remain closed through January as the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/seattle-childrens-hospital/">hospital</a> installs custom-built, high-efficiency particulate air - or HEPA - filters in each operating room and adjacent supply area. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/seattle-childrens-hospital/">hospital</a> is also installing a new rooftop air handler, he said.</p>
      <p>The operating rooms were also closed due to Aspergillus from May to early July of this year, and they have been tested for mold spores at least weekly since reopening.</p>
      <p>Planned surgeries have been postponed or moved to other hospitals or to the Seattle Children’s campus in Bellevue.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeff-sperring/">Sperring</a> apologized for the persistent mold issues and the illnesses and deaths they had caused, calling it a “heartbreaking time for all of us at Seattle Children’s” and acknowledging how devastating it had been for the families affected.</p>

        <p>Last month, the parents of a teenage boy sued, saying he had contracted meningitis because of a mold-related infection.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeff-sperring/">Sperring</a> promised a rigorous review of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/seattle-childrens-hospital/">hospital</a>’s failings, including an examination of its culture, leadership and “how our teams communicate problems and escalate concerns.”</p>
        <p>“We will do everything in our power to get this right, and we will not stop until we do,” he said.</p>
