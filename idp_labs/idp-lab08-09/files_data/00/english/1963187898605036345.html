      <p>CAIRO - 18 November 2019: In order to prevent avian flu and epidemic diseases, 1.1 million fowls in 1,862 farms and 727,424 households were vaccinated in October, Chairman of the Central Administration for Preventive Work at the General Authority for Veterinary Services Mohamed Atteya told Egypt Today. <br/><br/>The official added that the number of licenses issued to transport 3.4 million fowls between governorates is 4,030. <br/><br/>In a similar context, the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation announced in October banning imports of pet birds as a precautionary measure to prevent epidemic diseases, particularly avian influenza, and protect the countryâ€™s poultry resources. <br/><br/>Head of the Central Administration for Veterinary Quarantine Ahmed Abdel Karim told Egypt Today that the ban will end in March when the winter season finishes. The official added that biological safety measures in poultry farms and slaughterhouses across the country are being reviewed. The same checks take place in rural households where poultry farming is carried out.</p>
