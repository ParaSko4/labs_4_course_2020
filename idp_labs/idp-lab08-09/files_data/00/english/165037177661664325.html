        <b>Krzysztof Piatek is determined to double in value during his time at AC Milan, despite a difficult start to the 2019-20 season.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/milan/">AC Milan</a> striker <b>Krzysztof Piatek </b>wants to be worth as much as <b>€70million </b>by the time he eventually leaves the club. </p>
      <p>Piatek<b> signed for Milan in January </b>after enjoying an extraordinary start to life in<b> Serie A at Genoa.</b></p>
      <p>The Poland striker scored <b>13 league goals in 19 appearances</b> during the first half of the 2018-19 season, <b>leading to a big-money move</b> for a reported fee of<b> €35m.</b></p>
      <p>He had <b>no trouble maintaining his form following his switch to San Siro</b> - scoring a further nine league goals - but has <b>failed to recapture those levels </b>so far this campaign, netting just three times.</p>
      <p>However, Piatek <b>remains confident in his ability </b>to succeed with the Rossoneri.</p>
      <p>"When I moved to Milan<b> it all happened so fast that I didn't even ask questions</b>," the 24-year-old, who scored in Poland's 2-1 win over Israel on Saturday, told television channel TVP Sport.</p>

      <p><b>"I was focused on work, in football </b>yes, it's always about setting new goals. <b>Now I'm worth €38m</b>, the next time I change clubs, I'd like to be worth €60-70m".</p>
      <p>"I have to be ambitious,<b> I'll work for it, I'm at the beginning of my career, </b>it's only my second season in Serie A, one of the top five leagues [in Europe]."</p>
      <p>Piatek also believes the reaction of the Italian press to his loss of form has made matters more difficult at Milan, who sacked coach <b>Marco Giampaolo</b> earlier in the season and currently languish down in <b>14th place in the table.</b></p>
      <p>"I look in the mirror and<b> look for the blame inside of me.</b> At the beginning, as a team, we didn't create so many opportunities. We're improving,<b> I'm going to score again,"</b> he said during the interview.</p>
      <p>"For Italian journalists, one day you're the soccer pope and <b>the next day you're the worst player".</b></p>
      <p>"I accept it. <b>Nobody put themselves in my shoes</b>, the covers of the newspapers don't impact me."</p>
