        <b>Gareth Bale has given his an opinion on a flag which has gone viral on social media which reflected what Pedja Mijatovic said about the Welshman. Bale laughed and also talked about one thing he had never done in golf.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/g-bale-72/">Gareth Bale</a> <b>returned to competitive action</b>, but it was for Wales, not for <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/real-madrid">Real Madrid</a>. It came 42 days after he last played for Real Madrid, which has caused controversy. </p>
      <p>The player asked for his medical reports not to be released and<b> Zidane did not say in press conferences</b> whether he was injured or not. Simply that he was not available. </p>

      <p>There is a chant and a banner which said 'Wales, Golf, Madrid'<b> which has become very popular on social media</b>. </p>
      <p><b>The player also took advantage to send a message</b> to those who are spreading images of his doing things which are false. </p>
      <p><b>“I find it hilarious to be honest, </b>especially some of the pictures and stuff my friends send me. On one it said triple bogey - and <b>I've never had a triple bogey!</b>", he laughed. </p>
