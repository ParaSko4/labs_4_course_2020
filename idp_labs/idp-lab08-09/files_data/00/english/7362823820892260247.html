      <h1>Dunkin' bans 'double cup' in New England, swapping foam for paper</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:58:18+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 00:58</time> by <a rel="author">Frank Miles</a></address>
      <p>For Dunkin’ customers in New England, the days of the “double cup” -- a foam cup acting as a sleeve around a cold drink -- are over.</p>
      <p>New ads are telling customers, as <a href="https://www.boston25news.com/news/dunkin-donuts-officials-breaks-up-with-the-classic-hot-cup/1008899274">Boston 25</a> reported, that the “double cup is breaking up.” Executives at the chain said they’re moving to eliminate its polystyrene cups because foam isn’t sustainable.</p>
      <p>Cold drinks are being marketed as “iced, delicious and single.”</p>

      <p>The new campaign targets folks in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, for now, as The Associated Press reported.</p>
      <p>The double-cup habit was started in New England, and has been most common there.</p>
      <p>By Dec. 1, all the region’s stores are to start using paper cups that Dunkin’ said would be more environmentally friendly, as <a href="https://fox61.com/2019/11/15/dunkin-phases-out-foam-will-introduce-double-walled-paper-cups-next-month/">Fox 61</a> reported.</p>
