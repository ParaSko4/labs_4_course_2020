      <p><b>designed by <a href="http://www.heatherwick.com/">heatherwick studio</a> for the developer <a href="http://www.tiananchina.com/en/index.php">tian an china</a>, the project has not only been conceived as a building, but as a piece of topography.</b> taking the form of two tree-covered mountains, ‘1000 trees’ is populated by hundreds of structural columns that emerge as large planters — each holding a cluster of trees. all of which is documented in these new photographs of the project, taken by <b>qingyan zhu</b>.</p>

      <p><b><i>‘existing planning permission for two conventional shopping mall blocks had been granted for the site, but a huge, boxy building would need to be broken into smaller pieces in order to fit in with the surroundings,’</i> explains heatherwick studio.</b> <i>‘the integrated planting acts as a natural balancing element and the building’s edges are lowered to minimize the impact where it meets the art district and park, reducing the discernible threshold between them.’</i> see designboom’s previous coverage of the project <a href="https://www.designboom.com/architecture/heatherwick-studio-1000-trees-shanghai-construction-well-underway-china-07-31-2017/"><b>here</b></a>.</p>
