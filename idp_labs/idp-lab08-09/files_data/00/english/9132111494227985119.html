      <p>The President of the Western Regional House of Chiefs, Ogyeahohoo Yaw Gyebi II, is insisting that the National House of Chiefs has not adopted a ‘NO Vote’ campaign at any level of its Structure.</p>
      <p>Ogyeahohoo Yaw Gyebi II, who’s also the Head of the Governance and Development Committee of the House, in an interview with host Kwaku Owusu Adjei on Anopa Kasapa on Kasapa 102.5 FM on Monday said the seeming confusion in the House is regrettable, but the Standing Committee correspondence to the government did not contain its alleged “NO Vote” stance by the House.</p>
      <p>He queried: “if there was indeed a consensus of a sort backing a No Vote in the imminent referendum on local level elections why did the House wait for a certain political party to come up with a No Vote before the House’s statement backing same?”</p>
      <p>The President of the National House of Chiefs, Togbe Afede XIV has hit back at claims by chiefs that the house’s decision to strongly reject multi-party participation at the local governance level was unilateral.</p>
      <p>According to him, chiefs who criticized Thursday statement by him and his Vice asking Ghanaians to vote NO in the December 17 referendum are “dishonest” and exhibited “wanton mischief”.</p>
      <p>“The proposed referendum to allow partisan politics in our local elections was thoroughly discussed at the National House of Chiefs, both by the Standing Committee and the General Meeting.</p>
      <p>“The report presented by the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, Nana Krobea Asante, which formed the basis of the recent press statement was adopted ‘as the position of the House’, and it included the recommendation that ‘The House should strongly object to the notion that membership of local assemblies should exclusively comprise representatives of political parties, as in Parliament.</p>
      <p>“Any suggestions that the proposed referendum to allow partisan politics in our local elections was not discussed by the House is not only dishonest but wanton mischief,” Togbe Afede said in a new statement released on Sunday.</p>
      <p>But, Ogyeahohoo Yaw Gyebi II in a reaction, said he’s restrained himself from responding to the name-calling by the President for exposing the falsehood in his No Vote claims.</p>
      <p>He’s asked for calm among his colleagues urging all to wait for a scheduled meeting on 12th December or any other emergency meeting that may be called forthwith to iron out the issues.</p>
