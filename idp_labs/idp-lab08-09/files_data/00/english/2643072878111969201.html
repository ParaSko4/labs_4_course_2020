      <p>The governorship candidate of the Social Democratic Party in Kogi State, <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/natasha-akpoti/"><u><b>Natasha Akpoti</b></u></a>, has accused the governor of the state, <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/yahaya-bello"><u><b>Yahaya Bello</b></u></a>, of ordering her assassination.</p>
      <p>The SDP governorship candidate stated this on Monday on her Twitter account.</p>
      <p>She wrote:<i> “Gov Yahaya Bello has ordered for my assassination.”</i></p>
      <p>Akpoti while speaking on the Saturday election called for the cancellation of the gubernatorial election in Kogi Central and part of Lokoja, the state capital.</p>
      <p>She stated that the electoral process in Kogi Central and other parts of the state were far from a credible election.</p>
      <p>The SDP governorship candidate, therefore, charged the <b>Independent National Electoral Commission</b>, to cancel the elections and conduct a rerun.</p>
      <p>Akpoti made this call in a statement released on Sunday. She wrote, <i>“Ballot boxes were destroyed and burnt in Okene, Adavi, Ajaokuta and Ogori Magongo and Okehi Local government areas and other parts of the state.”</i></p>
