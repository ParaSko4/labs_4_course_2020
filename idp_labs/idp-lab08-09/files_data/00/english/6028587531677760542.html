      <p>On their 2015 song “All Bad Things,” Hollywood hard rockers Mötley Crüe lamented that “all bad things must end, all bad things must die.” Apparently, that includes restrictive contracts, as the chart-topping band is ripping up its cessation of touring agreement and hitting the road again.Following a series of rumors and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/quentinsinger/2019/11/18/mtley-cre-scrap-retirement-plans-in-favor-of-2020-stadium-tour/">reports</a> from undisclosed sources, the band—singer Vince Neil, drummer Tommy Lee, bassist Nikki Sixx and guitarist Mick Mars—confirmed the news on Monday afternoon by posting a video in which they literally blow up their former contract, which prohibited them from touring after playing their final show on Dec. 31, 2015.</p>
      <p>Rapper Machine Gun Kelly, who played Lee in Netflix biopic <i>The Dirt</i>, adapted from the band’s scandalous 2001 memoir, narrated the video. “In the years since [their final tour], Mötley Crüe became more popular than ever and gained an entirely new legion of fans, who, along with diehard Crüeheads, demanded the band tear up that stupid contract and come out of retirement. They knew that if they were ever to stand onstage together again, that contract would have to be destroyed,” Kelly says. “Well, destruction has never been an issue for Mötley Crüe. </p>
      <p>“Since playing Tommy Lee in <i>The Dirt</i>, so many of my fans have said how they wish they could've seen the real Mötley Crüe play live,” Kelly said in a press release. “I never thought I would see the day when this would become a reality. But the fans spoke and Mötley Crüe listened!”</p>
      <p>Following the release of <i>The Dirt</i>, Mötley Crüe enjoyed a nearly 600% <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/quentinsinger/2019/11/18/mtley-cre-scrap-retirement-plans-in-favor-of-2020-stadium-tour/">streaming boost</a> on Spotify and a 900% bump on Apple Music. The accompanying <i>Dirt Soundtrack</i>, which serves as a compilation album and includes four new songs (including a cover of Madonna’s “Like a Virgin”), debuted at No. 10 on the Billboard 200.</p>
      <p>Mötley Crüe netted several multi-platinum albums in the 1980s, including the chart-topping <i>Dr. Feelgood</i>, which has been certified 6x platinum by the RIAA. Joining them on tour will be fellow chart-topping hard rock acts Def Leppard and Poison. Tour dates have not yet been announced. Mötley Crüe’s comeback news closely follows reunion announcements from <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebaltin/2019/10/31/my-chemical-romance-announce-reunion-show-at-las-shrine-december-20/">My Chemical Romance</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebaltin/2019/11/01/confirmed-rage-against-the-machine-to-reunite-in-2020-headline-coachella/">Rage Against the Machine</a> and the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebaltin/2019/11/15/the-black-crowes-turn-back-the-clock-at-jubilant-troubadour-show/">Black Crowes</a>.</p>
