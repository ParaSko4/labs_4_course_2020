      <h1>Gousto investor MMC Ventures reveals £100m scaleup fund</h1>

      <p>MMC Ventures has today revealed the close of its first fund for re-investing in its own portfolio of mature companies at £100m.</p>
      <p>The Scaleup Fund will provide capital to current firms in MMC’s roster that have outgrown the firm’s other funds, such as Interactive Investor and Safeguard Global.</p>
      <p>MMC, which was an early investor in the likes of Bloom &amp; Wild, Gousto and healthcare app Echo, has now raised £200m in the last 12 months alone alongside its £52m early-stage fund and annual EIS relief raise.</p>
      <p>The firm relocated to Holborn earlier this year as it grows its team.</p>

      <p>“2019 has been a big year for our firm, and the launch of our new Scale Up Fund represents a scale up moment for MMC as well as a significant innovation in the UK venture market,” said Bruce Macfarlane, co-founder and managing partner at MMC.</p>
      <p>“This fund allows us to double down on our most successful businesses while enabling our investors, and others, to take full or partial exits from early investments.</p>
      <p>“We will continue to focus on our core specialism as a series A investor, but I am delighted we can support entrepreneurs with funding through their lifecycle, from the very beginning, through growth, then later stage expansion capital.”</p>
      <p>Bluetower Associates acted as an adviser and placement agent to MMC for the Scaleup Fund’s raising.</p>
