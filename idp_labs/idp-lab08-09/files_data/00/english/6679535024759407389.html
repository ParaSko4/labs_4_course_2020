      <h2>Nodal agency is Central Road Research Institute</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:56:46+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 00:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/S-Anil-Radhakrishnan-534/" target="_blank">S. Anil Radhakrishnan</a></address>
      <p>A web-based software system will be introduced by the Public Works Department (PWD) for the upcoming digitised road maintenance management system (RMMS). It will rely on the analysis and condition of road, vehicle density and quality.</p>
      <p>The RMMS is part of digitising the assets of the PWD to execute maintenance of 4,300 km of State Highways spread over 14 districts.</p>
      <h3>WB funds</h3>
      <p>The State Highways in the districts of Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam had been taken up on pilot basis with the World Bank (WB) providing funds under Kerala State Transport Project (KSTP) Phase II for the RMMS.</p>
      <p>The PWD has roped in the Delhi-based Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) as the nodal agency for executing the RMMS.</p>
      <h3>Training</h3>
      <p>With the digitisation of State Highways, the PWD is of the view that the disaster management and relief measures in case of natural calamities such as floods, landslips and cyclone can be improved.</p>
      <p>The employees of the technical wing of the PWD had already been imparted training to use network survey vehicle to take data.</p>
      <h3>Digitisation</h3>
      <p>The data from the remaining 12 districts would be taken up subsequently, sources in PWD said. It</p>
      <p>is for the first time since its inception that the PWD is venturing to digitise the assets. All matter regarding the roads will be digitised under the RMMS.</p>
      <p>The RMMS will come in handy for the annual road maintenance, help the preparation of the budget for the maintenance and to take up emergency works in the roads across the State.</p>
      <p>Already, the PWD has posted a Chief Engineer solely for maintenance.</p>
      <h3>International bids</h3>
      <p>The KSTP has already floated international bids for the supply, installation, testing and commissioning of the web-based software system for the RMMS.</p>
      <p>The bidding will be conducted using the international competitive bidding procedures specified in the World Bankâ€™s guidelines.</p>
