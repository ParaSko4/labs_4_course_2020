      <h1>Huge Flow Country wildfire 'doubled Scotland's emissions'</h1>

        <b>A massive wildfire on peatland in the far north in May doubled Scotland's greenhouse gas emissions for the six days it burnt, a study has estimated.</b>
      </p>
      <p>About 22 sq miles (5,700 hectares) of blanket bog in the Flow Country, which stretches across Caithness and Sutherland, was affected.</p>
      <p>The WWF Scotland study claimed 700,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent was released into the atmosphere as a result.</p>
      <p>That is similar to the amount released across the rest of Scotland.</p>
      <p>Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, contribute to climate warming and are released by many activities such as energy supply, industrial processes, transport, heating and agriculture.</p>

      <p>Peat bogs are an important natural store for carbon.</p>
      <p>The Flow Country, home to the largest continuous peatbog in Europe, is estimated to hold almost 1.5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e).</p>
      <p>The study, commissioned by environmental campaign group WWF, called for more government investment to protect and improve peat bogs.</p>
      <p>Head of policy Gina Hanrahan said: "This analysis puts into stark figures the importance of our peatlands and the huge cost to climate and nature when something goes wrong."</p>

      <p>The Flow Country peatbog is formed from layers of dead vegetation such a sphagnum moss. Because of the waterlogged conditions, the plants do not decompose which traps carbon in the peat soil.</p>
      <p>Experts say the quality of peatlands can play a significant role in minimising emissions in the event of a wildfire.</p>
      <p>Emma Goodyer, from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), said: "Healthy peatlands are more resilient to fire. A great deal of peatland restoration work is being undertaken across the UK already with at least 150 projects carried out in Scotland.</p>
      <p>"However, we need to increase the scale of funding available for peatland restoration if we are to urgently respond to the climate crisis and to increase the resilience of our peatlands."</p>

      <p>A Scottish government spokesman said restoring peatland had an important part to play in delivering climate change ambitions.</p>
      <p>He said the government was committed to delivering the peatland restoration targets set out in the Climate Change Plan.</p>
      <p>"We are currently updating our Climate Change Plan which will set out detailed actions to deliver on our climate change ambitions," the spokesman said.</p>
      <p>The fire stretched from the outskirts of Melvich on the north coast to the village of Forsinard, about 15 miles further south.</p>
      <p>A long-term project is being carried out in the Flow Country to estimate the ecological impact of the fire.</p>
      <p>Measurements gathered before the fire give researchers a unique data set for understanding the way vegetation and water quality has changed.</p>
