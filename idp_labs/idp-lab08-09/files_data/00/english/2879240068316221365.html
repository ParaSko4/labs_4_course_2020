      <h1>Arianespace will orbit TIBA-1 and Inmarsat GX5 with Ariane 5</h1>

      <p>On its fourth flight with Ariane 5 in 2019, Arianespace will orbit two telecommunications satellites at the service of long-term customers: TIBA-1 for Thales Alenia Space and Airbus Defence and Space, on behalf of the Government of Egypt; and the GX5 satellite for the operator Inmarsat.</p>
      <p>Through this mission, Arianespace highlights its ability to be at the service of innovative satellite solutions for commercial and institutional needs.</p>
      <p>VA250 will be the 250th launch of an Ariane rocket, which lifted off for the first time on December 24, 1979.</p>
      <p>Flight VA250 will be performed from Ariane Launch Complex No. 3 (ELA 3) in Kourou, French Guiana.</p>
      <p>The Launch Readiness Review (LRR) will take place on Wednesday, November 20, 2019 in Kourou to authorize the start of operations for the final countdown.</p>
      <p>TIBA-1 is a civil and government telecommunication satellite for Egypt. It was developed by Thales Alenia Space and Airbus Defence and Space as co-prime contractors, with Thales Alenia Space acting as the consortium's lead partner. TIBA-1 will be owned and operated by the government of Egypt.</p>
      <p>TIBA-1 will be the fourth satellite launched by Arianespace for Egypt. It will be deployed by Arianespace into geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), subsequently transitioning to its operational orbital slot position at 35.5 East.</p>
      <p>Airbus Defence and Space is Arianespace's direct customer for this mission, continuing a fruitful cooperation between the two companies that extends back to Arianespace's creation in 1980.</p>
      <p>GX5 is a mobile communications satellite built by Thales Alenia Space for Inmarsat. Inmarsat's fifth Ka-band Global Xpress (GX) satellite, GX5 will be the most advanced in the GX fleet, which in less than four years has become the gold standard for seamless, globally available, mobile broadband services.</p>
      <p>Located in a geostationary orbit at 11 East, GX5 will deliver greater capacity than the entire existing GX fleet (GX1-GX4) combined and will support the rapid growth in customer demand for GX services in Europe and the Middle East, particularly for aviation passenger Wi-Fi and commercial maritime services.</p>
      <p>This is the 10th time that Inmarsat has chosen Arianespace's launch services, demonstrating a well-established trust - with the two companies' relationship dating back to 1981.</p>
