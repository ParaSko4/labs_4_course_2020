Two small ride-hailing companies are combining in an effort to slow the march of Uber Technologies Inc. around the globe. Tel Aviv-based Gett Inc. said its paying $200 million to acquire Juno, a New York startup that endeared itself to drivers by offering company stock and better pay than Uber.

      <p>One of ride-hailing’s most infamous operators is cutting the engine after three years, and parent company Gett is encouraging riders to join Lyft, its new partner, if they feel like it. Gett announced <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gett-announces-closure-of-juno-and-strategic-partnership-with-lyft-300960004.html">in a press release</a> Monday that the company is shutting down New York City ride-hail app Juno effective today, and that the company will be partnering with Lyft for its business-facing US operations going forward.</p>
      <p>The company said the steps came “as a result of both Gett's increased focus on the corporate transportation sector” and what it called “misguided regulations” <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/janetwburns/2019/11/08/will-platforms-like-uber-and-lyft-ever-stop-fighting-the-law-or-their-workers/">enacted in NYC</a> earlier this year. Gett CEO Dave Waiser commented, "This development reinforces Gett's strategy to build a profitable company focused on the corporate transportation sector, a market worth $1 trillion each year."</p>
      <p>Co-founded in 2016 by two-time founder-and-flipper Talmon Marco, Juno was advertised as a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/janetwburns/2016/08/25/a-new-ride-hailing-app-is-disrupting-the-industry-by-treating-drivers-like-people/#6043733861d5">driver-friendly alternative</a> to Uber and Lyft. Among other things, Juno famously planned to let drivers earn shares in the company for their work on the road. The company was acquired in 2017 for $200 million by Israeli rival Gett, which has been steadily expanding its European reach as a black car and business-to-business network. Juno continued to operate in New York as Juno by Gett.</p>

      <p>At the time of its acquisition, Juno's equity program <a href="https://qz.com/969601/juno-ubers-driver-friendly-competitor-sold-to-gett-for-200-million-but-left-little-for-its-drivers/">was also ended</a>, and drivers who had accumulated company shares were notified by email that they would be automatically cashed out; at that time, drivers reported that the most they received was $100. Two months later, a group of drivers then filed suit against Juno <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/janetwburns/2017/06/20/ride-hail-drivers-in-nyc-are-suing-juno-for-securities-fraud/#49a319931b93">for alleged securities fraud</a>.</p>
      <p>In a phone call today, a spokesperson for Gett said the company can’t comment on ongoing litigation. Gett also declined to say how many drivers were still using Juno’s platform as of today, nor how many rides they’ve been providing lately.</p>
      <p><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/ridehailing-service-gett-shuts-down-juno-partners-with-lyft-in-profitability-push-192200773.html">Yahoo Finance</a> wrote Monday that Gett’s shuttering of Juno and partnership with Lyft is “all part of a pivot to a business-to-business model that Gett quietly made when it acquired Juno; this Lyft deal represents a doubling-down on that path. Juno was the last part of Gett that was consumer-facing, so it no longer fit.” Lyft’s stock price also <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/lyft-stock-price-gains-on-gett-partnership-juno-shutdown-2019-11-1028697912">saw a boost</a> on Monday.</p>
      <p>According to the company’s release, “Juno drivers will be paid in full by Juno for all rides completed by Juno's service end-date.” Gett also said that all Juno riders will receive a digital invitation to join Lyft.</p>
