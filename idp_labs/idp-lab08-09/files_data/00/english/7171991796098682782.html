      <h1>If You Can’t Buy The Keyboard You Want, Build It Instead</h1>

      <p>The great thing about being a maker is that when the market fails to meet your needs, you can strike out on your own. [GuzziGuy] did just that, <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/fGa13nZ">building a bespoke mechanical keyboard that’s stylish to boot.</a></p>
      <p>The aim was to create a keyboard well suited to working without a mouse, and with a keypad on the opposite side to suit a left-hander’s predilections. The case consists of an aluminium top plate with an attractive walnut base, both cut on a Workbee CNC machine. Keycaps are sourced from YDMK and Amazon, with the parts chosen giving the build a striking early 1980s workstation look.</p>
      <p>The keys are handwired to a series of DuPont connectors for easy disassembly. These hook up to an <a href="https://keeb.io/products/elite-c-usb-c-pro-micro-replacement-arduino-compatible-atmega32u4">Elite-C controller</a>, a USB-C remix of the popular Arduino Pro Micro. Based on the ATmega32U4, it’s got native USB HID functionality, making it perfect for keyboard builds.</p>
      <p>The fit and finish is what really makes this project, going to show that a few hours well spent on the CNC can turn you out a beautiful project. As far as mechanical keyboards go, <a href="https://hackaday.com/2018/08/05/custom-designed-keyboard-needs-a-custom-made-metal-case/">your imagination really is the limit!</a></p>
