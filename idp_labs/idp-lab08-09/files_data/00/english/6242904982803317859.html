      <p>He had earlier represented Ghana at U17 and U20 levels.</p>
      <p>“He [Kudus] is amazing, you could see his contribution [against South Africa] - his link-up from the wings, midfield and from attack; has been phenomenal," Kingston, who is on coaching attachment at Nordsjaelland, said, as reported by Ghanaguardian.</p>
      <p>"He’s someone I saw playing when he was 13.</p>
      <p>"He went through Right to Dream Academy and now he’s doing very well with FC Nordsjaelland."</p>
