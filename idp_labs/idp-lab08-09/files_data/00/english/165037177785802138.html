        <b>After more than a month without playing for Real Madrid, Bale did so with Wales. The attacker has stated in the press conference before the game against Hungary, that he is already ready to have more minutes.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/g-bale-72/">Gareth Bale</a> has been under the spotlight for weeks because nobody knew why he was out for so long. It was due to an injury, but Madrid ddi not include this in their medical statements and Zidane did not know how to respond to this case.</p>
      <p>The French coach only said that <b>the player wasn't available</b>, something that <b>Bale had already proved wrong after playing</b> against Azerbaijan for an hour.</p>
      <p>"I have not played for four weeks and for this it was important to have this hour against Azerbaijan. <b>I am ready"</b>, he said in the press conference before Wales' game against Hungary.</p>

      <p>Wales have the possibility of classifying for the Euro 2020 and Bale analysed the situation, as well as asking the fans to be as loud as possible.</p>
      <p>"Of course it's been a season of ups and downs, but the most important thingÂ is that <b>we haven't lost since the last game against Hungary. </b>The youngsters have done well and we have a good mix. Classifying would be great, but we cannot think about this as yet and we still ahve to concentrate on the game as a team and as a squad as a whole. We've known the euphoria of being in the UEFA EURO 2016 and also staying out of the World Cup, so both experiences give us an advantage to know how to deal with the situation. <b>We already know how to qualify</b> with young players and we know that it will be a good game. We want <b>the fans to make themselves heard and be the twelth player,</b>" he continued.</p>
      <p>Bale finished by praising players such as Kieffer Moore and emphasised that he is only focusing on doing the best he can on the pitch: "We have more options in attack now abd I really don't feel much pressure<b>. I always give the best that I have to help the team</b> and this is what matters to me personally. Playing is the only thing that matters."</p>
