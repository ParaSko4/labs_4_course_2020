      <p>A Nigerian High Court in Abuja has dismissed a suit filed by professional photographer Mrs. Busola Dakolo against Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo over an alleged rape in 2002.<br/><br/>Presiding judge, Justice Oathman A. Musa on Thursday ruled that Dakolo’s case against the Senior Pastor of the Commonwealth of Zion Assembly (Coza) was aimed more at cruelty than obtaining justice as the case was purely sentimental.<br/><br/>The court further ordered Dakolo to pay N1,000,000 ($2,770) for wasting the court’s time, adding the sum could have been higher since her suit was an abuse of the judicial process.<br/><br/>Busola Dakolo who is also wife of musician, Timi Dakolo months ago accused pastor Fatoyinbo of rape, adding that the alleged action of the pastor, as well as his denial in a statement adversely, affected her marital sex life. She wanted publications in print and electronic media from the pastor denoting his repentance. Fatoyinbo’s lawyer, Alex Iziyon (SAN), however, argued that the prayer could not be granted, describing it as a frivolous suit.<br/><br/>The Nigeria Police Force has noted the probe into the allegation of rape against Fatoyinbo was slow because of the time factor spanning some 17 years.<br/><br/>According to Dakolo, Fatoyinbo allegedly raped her twice, first at her family home and then on the bonnet of his car while she was a teenager.<br/>Nigerians were largely miffed by the allegation, especially when a pastor who ought to know better was the supposed culprit. Fatoyinbo who leads his 16,000 strong member church denied the allegation. Featured Video</p>
