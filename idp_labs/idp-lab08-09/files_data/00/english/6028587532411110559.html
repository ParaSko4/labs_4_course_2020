      <p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/trump-administration-combating-epidemic-youth-e-cigarette-use-plan-clear-market-unauthorized-non?utm_&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=stratcomms&amp;utm_content=pressrelease&amp;utm_campaign=CTP%20News%26Connect%26SoS%3A%20HHS%20Youth%20E-Cig%20Use%20Response%20-%2091119">The statement released by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on September 11, 2019</a>, seemed pretty clear. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said that “The Trump Administration is making it clear that we intend to clear the market of flavored e-cigarettes to reverse the deeply concerning epidemic of youth e-cigarette use that is impacting children, families, schools and communities.” That’s clearly two “clears” in one sentence. Azar added, “We will not stand idly by as these products become an on-ramp to combustible cigarettes or nicotine addiction for a generation of youth.” So what has happened since then?Again “clear the market” seemed pretty clear. And so does “not stand idly.” <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/idly">Dictionary.com defines “idle”</a> as “not working or active; doing nothing: or not spent or filled with activity.” What then did a tweet from President Donald Trump say regarding this matter exactly 61 days after the FDA announcement? He is planning to have a meeting:</p>
      <p>It took two months to let us know that there will be a meeting to talk about how to deal with this health crisis? Then, there’s the mention of jobs. Over one in four high schoolers (<a href="https://www.lung.org/about-us/media/press-releases/national-youth-tobacco-survey.html">27.5% according to the American Lung Association</a>) are now considered current e-cigarettes users. There have been at least 2,172 reported cases of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury (EVALI) from 49 states, the District of Columbia, and two U.S. territories with at least 42 confirmed deaths, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html#latest-outbreak-information">according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>. An analysis has shown that 14% of those affected are under 18 years old, and 40% are between 18 and 24 years of age. And the focus is on jobs? Whose jobs specifically are of interest? And why is the vaping industry listed before medical professionals and individual state representatives in Trump’s tweet? So, so many questions.</p>
      <p>Here’s one more. Whatever happened to “clear the market”? Well, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/health/trump-vaping-ban.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage">Annie Karni, Maggie Haberman and Sheila Kaplan reported the following for the <i>New York Times</i></a>:</p>
      <p>“On a flight on Nov. 4, while traveling to a political rally in Kentucky, Mr. Trump was swayed by the advisers who warned him of political repercussions to any sweeping restrictions. Reviewing talking points on the ban aboard the plane with advisers, Mr. Trump decided to cancel the administration’s rollout of an announcement, which included a news conference that Alex M. Azar II, the health and human services secretary, was planning to hold on the issue the next day. Instead, another meeting was proposed.”</p>
      <p>One year before the 2020 Presidential elections, is one “job” of concern then the President’s job? <i>The New York Times</i> report seemed to suggest so. Former New York City Mayor and the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Ambassador for Non Communicable Diseases (NCD) Mike Bloomberg responded to the revelation with the following tweet:</p>
      <p>Bloomberg, a billionaire who is vying for the Democratic Party nomination for next year’s Presidential election, is also the founder of Bloomberg Philanthropies. In September, Bloomberg Philanthropies launched the <a href="https://fightflavoredecigs.org/">Protect Kids: Fight Flavored E-Cigarettes</a> initiative with one of the stated goals being to “<a href="https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/press-releases/2019_09_10_fightflavoredecigs">remove flavored e-cigarettes from the marketplace.</a>”</p>
      <p>The argument for vaping has been that it is better than smoking tobacco. There is some evidence that this may be the case. For example, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109719381938?via%3Dihub">a study just published in the <i>Journal of the American College of Cardiology</i>, nicknamed <i>JACC</i></a> showed that switching from regular cigarettes to e-cigarettes was associated with significant improvements in two aspects of blood vessel health that may affect the risk of heart disease (endothelial function and vascular stiffness) within just a month of the switch. However, the recent surge in vaping-related lung problems have raised questions about the safety of e-cigarettes and what contaminants may be present in at least certain brands. More scientific research is really needed to evaluate the benefits and safety of vaping.</p>

      <p>Regardless of the potential benefits of vaping, few health experts would argue that vaping is better than not using either cigarettes or e-cigarettes. Thus,the concern is that many of the over 15,000 e-cigarette flavors currently available will mask the true taste of vaping and lure kids, most whom are not smoking yet, into the habit. The nicotine in the vapes may subsequently get kids hooked. That’s why the FDA, at least originally, Bloomberg Philanthropies, and states such as New York and Michigan have sought to “clear the market of flavored e-cigarettes,” <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2019/09/17/new-york-here-is-the-first-state-to-ban-flavored-e-cigarettes/">as I reported previously for <i>Forbes</i></a>. Of course, this alone won’t stop the youth vaping crisis, but the thought is that it is better than doing nothing.</p>
      <p>Moreover, what is the health rationale of keeping so many flavored e-cigarettes on the market? When there is a health crisis, shouldn’t the focus be on alleviating or better yet eliminating the crisis? And not on jobs in a certain sector or the job of a certain person? Also, shouldn’t health experts, the ones who are focused on the health of children, be front and center in the discussion and the resulting strategy?</p>
      <p>The analogy would be getting into a car accident with people injured and bleeding and going to see the car dealer “together” with a doctor and some individual body representatives. Would you want them to then say, “the injuries and bleeding, together with jobs in the car industry will be a focus”?</p>
      <p>It is now unclear what specifically the Trump administration will do about the youth vaping crisis. Dealing with a public health crisis requires strong decisive statements followed very quickly with strong corresponding action. Issuing strong statements followed by a retreat can lead to confusion and a loss of confidence in our country’s ability to respond to a crisis. The FDA statement back in September seemed quite clear in expressing the Trump administration’s desire to “clear the market of flavored e-cigarettes.” Clearly, something has happened since then.</p>
