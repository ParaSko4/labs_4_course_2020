      <p><b>(TRINIDAD GUARDIAN)</b> —   Short­ly af­ter UNC of­fi­cials spoke out against T&amp;T’s run­away crime sit­u­a­tion at a po­lit­i­cal meet­ing on Thurs­day night came news that Princes Town MP Bar­ry Padarath had been robbed at gun­point. Some mem­bers of the par­ty hur­ried­ly left a cot­tage meet­ing at Soledad Road, Clax­ton Bay on Thurs­day night af­ter hear­ing about Padarath’s or­deal.</p>
      <p>The Princes Town MP, who lives at Roys­to­nia, Cou­va, made a re­port at the Cou­va Po­lice Sta­tion and some of his col­leagues went there to lend sup­port.</p>
      <p>Po­lice said Padarath was held up at gun­point in Cou­va and his ve­hi­cle, PDM 23, a black Toy­ota Pra­do and his cell phone were stolen. News of the rob­bery was post­ed on the UNC’s in­ter­nal What­sapp chat and shared by Cou­va South MP Rudranath In­dars­ingh.</p>
      <p>This is not the first time that Padarath was a vic­tim of crime. In Ju­ly 2017, he and his fam­i­ly were held at gun­point at their home and robbed. The MP said he was hold­ing Hin­du prayers for three nights to cel­e­brate his birth­day and on the third day of the prayers he was robbed.</p>
      <p>At the time, Padarath said the Cou­va po­lice took more than 30 min­utes to get to the scene be­cause they had on­ly one car at the sta­tion and there were sev­er­al oth­er rob­beries in the dis­trict that same night.</p>
      <p>Cou­va po­lice said they were in­ves­ti­gat­ing the lat­est rob­bery.</p>
