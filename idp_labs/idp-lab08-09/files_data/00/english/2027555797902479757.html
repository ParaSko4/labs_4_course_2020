      <h1>50th IFFI pays homage to the New Indian cinema</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:41:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 00:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/roshan-h-nair" target="_blank">Roshan H Nair</a></address>
      <p>The schedule for the 50th edition of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) is out, revealing that the golden jubilee edition of India’s most prominent film festival will have a retrospective of the New Indian Cinema.</p>
      <p>The New Indian Cinema, sometimes called the Indian New Wave, was a movement of sorts that started in the late 1960s and went on till the 90s, where filmmakers used experimental narrative techniques to present complex social issues.</p>
      <p>Many filmmakers associated with the New Cinema were passouts from the Film and Television Institute of India, where they were exposed to the best of European cinema.</p>
      <p>The New Wave movement often stood in stark contrast to the cinema of bollywood as well as the realistic tone of Bengali auteur Satyajit Ray.</p>
      <p>In fact, some of the New Wave filmmakers, such as John Abraham (Malayalam and Tamil), Kumar Shahani (Hindi) and Mani Kaul (Hindi) — all of whose films are being screened at the festival — consciously moved away from what they saw as the Hollywood-inspired style of Ray.</p>
      <p>Some other New Cinema filmmakers such as Adoor Gopalakrishnan (Malayalam) and Shyam Benegal (Hindi) acknowledged Ray’s influences.</p>
      <p>Other filmmakers included in the retrospective are Ritwik Ghatak (Bengali), Mrinal Sen (Bengali), G Aravindan (Malayalam).</p>
      <p>IFFI begins on November 20 and concludes on November 28.</p>
