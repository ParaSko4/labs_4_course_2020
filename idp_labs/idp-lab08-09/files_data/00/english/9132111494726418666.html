      <p>On Tuesday, 26 November, the Kempinski Hotel will come alive as various dignitaries gather to launch the “Coat of Many Colours” project. This is an initiative by the Mama Rina Foundation, with support from the first lady of Ghana, Mrs. Rebecca Akufo Addo.</p>
      <p>The “Coat of Many Colours” project aims to open small workshops in rural villages, that will sew clothes using leftover fabrics from Ghana’s textile manufacturing companies such as GTP. The clothes will be designed by designers who have commited to partner with the Mama Rina Foundation. Inspired by the popular Dolly Parton song, “Coat of Many Colours”, the Mama Rina Foundation seeks to distribute some of the clothes for free to the needy in society. This project hopes to enrich and empower the lives of many underprivilaged people by providing them with employment through the sewing of clothes as well as other ancilliary jobs.</p>
      <p>The Launch of the Coats of Many Colours will be a fundraising and fashion show gala night that aims to raise funds in support of the project. Gracing this occasion will be the First Lady of the Republic of Ghana, Mrs. Rebecca Akufo-Addo.</p>
      <p>The event will show-case a fashion show by children and adults from the Gbantana – Cheshire village in the Greater Accra region. They will show-case for the first time, on the run-way, an exciting collection of the “Coat of Many Colours” clothing made from pieces of fabrics from GTP, ATL among others. The night will also be interspersed with music by Okyeame Kwame, Dela Botri and the Hewale Sounds, and Sina Soul who will treat the audience to a beautiful rendition of Dolly Parton’s famous “Coat of Many Colours” song.</p>
      <p>The Mama Rina Foundation’s goal is to empower the underprivileged and make a difference in the lives of other people.</p>
