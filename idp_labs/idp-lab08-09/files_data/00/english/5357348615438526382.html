      <p><b>Manchester recently honoured two of its valiant sons — Stanley Francis, 98, and Aston Senior, 95, two living survivors of World War II, which ended 74 years ago. It was Remembrance Sunday, November 10 — a day before the November 11 official commemoration of Armistice Day, which marked the end of World War I.</b> <br/><br/>Remembrance Day now incorporates the end of both World Wars and Manchester remembered its  fallen soldiers of the wars, with a civic ceremony of wreath-laying at the Cenotaph at the Cecil Charlton Park in the Mandeville town square, followed by the sounding of the Last Post and the Reveille and a march past and salute of uniformed groups.</p>
