        <b>A late Lionel Messi penalty gave Argentina a 2-2 draw versus Uruguay in an international friendly in Tel Aviv. Edinson Cavani and Luis Suarez gave Uruguay the lead twice and Sergio Aguero made it 1-1 in the second half.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://es.besoccer.com/jugador/l-messi-23569">Lionel Messi</a> <b>gave Argentina a stoppage time equaliser </b>in a friendly against Uruguay to get a 2-2 draw in both countries' last game before 2022 World Cup qualifying begins. </p>
      <p>Aguero and Suarez had chances in the first 20 minutes before <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/e-cavani-1202/">Cavani</a> <b>put Uruguay ahead after 34 minutes</b>. Lucas Torreira's lovely chip pass fell to Suarez and he squared for the PSG man to tap home. Four minutes later, <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/p-dybala-115525/">Dybala</a> <b>thought he had levelled,</b> but he accidentally handball in the build up and so it did not count. Argentina finished the half strongly after 10-15 minutes of good play by Tabarez's men, <b>but it was 0-1 at half-time.</b> </p>
      <p>In the second period, Argentina did not create much going forward, but <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/s-aguero-23530/">Sergio Aguero</a><b> levelled for Argentina 26 minutes from time </b>after heading home Messi's free-kick. </p>

      <p>Two minutes later, he saw an effort deflected wide and then shortly afterwards,<b> Pezzella brought down </b><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/l-suarez-29685/">Luis Suarez</a> on the edge of the box and he was made to pay for it. <b>The Barca player hit a splendid free-kick over the wall </b>and into the goal. Andrada got a hand to it, but he could only tip it into the roof of the net. </p>
      <p>Argentina then pressed looking for an equaliser and Sergio Aguero hit over the crossbar before the Man City forward <b>was denied by a fabulous save from Campana</b> in the 90th minute. However, Argentina were not to be denied. Saravia's cross in was flicked on by Lautaro Martinez and the ball hit Caceres' outstretched arm. <b>It was a clear penalty and </b>Messi kept his cool from the spot to send the keeper the wrong way. </p>
      <p>The game ended 2-2 and it was probably a fair result as both teams had good spells of play. but Argentina were probably a bit better overall. <b>The tempo in the second half was much quicker</b> than in the first and Messi's late penalty meant Scaloni's men finished the international break unbeaten. Their next matches are in March <b>when South American World Cup qualifying begins</b>. </p>
