      <h1>The most fuel-efficient car in South Africa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/hanno-labuschagne" target="_blank">Hanno Labuschagne</a></address>
      <p>Renault has won the title of most fuel-efficient car brand in WesBank and FNB’s first Fuel Economy Tour.</p>
      <p>The purpose of the event was to provide consumers with accurate fuel consumption figures for 40 popular cars in South Africa.</p>
      <p>The five-day event concluded on 16 November and encompassed 32 vehicle classes.</p>
      <p>These included entries from Kia, Fiat, Hyundai, Toyota, Lexus, Mitsubishi, Suzuki, Honda, Ford, Renault, Nissan, and Mahindra.</p>
      <p>Participants then drove along a 2,500km route from Johannesburg to Cape Town to test the fuel efficiencies of the cars.</p>

      <h3>Rules and monitoring measures</h3>
      <p>To monitor each vehicle’s progress along the route, trackers were installed in the cars.</p>
      <p>The equipment included tracking sensors and dash cams, as well as interior cameras.</p>
      <p>Using this hardware, the average speeds of the vehicles were tracked and it was ensured that they did not deviate from the route.</p>
      <p>Participants were required to drive as closely as possible to the speed limits and finish specific sections within a given time.</p>
      <p>“The objective of this event was to provide consumers with fuel consumption figures that are relevant to going on a road trip in South Africa using main roads,” said Fuel Economy Tour chief organiser Charl Wilken.</p>

      <h3>Winning brands</h3>
      <p>To determine the winner, the average consumption of the three best-performing vehicles from each car brand was used.</p>
      <p>The Renault Captur, Duster Techroad, and Kwid Climber performed best, and Suzuki took second place with its Baleno, Ignis, and Swift.</p>
      <p>Third place went to Mahindra, with one KUV 100 and two XUV 300 vehicles taking part.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Renault</b> – 5.07 l/100km</li>
        <li><b>Suzuki</b> – 5.10 l/100km</li>

      </ol>
      <p>Nissan and Ford claimed the fourth and fifth place, respectively.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Most-efficient cars</h3>
      <p>When looking at individual models, the Renault Captur 1.5-litre diesel-turbo was the car with the lowest average consumption.</p>
      <p>It was followed by the Toyota Aygo and the Nissan Qashqai 1.5-litre diesel turbo.</p>

      <h3>Bakkie efficiency</h3>
      <p>The turbo diesel double cab class for engines with less than 2,500cc was headed up by the Ford Ranger 2.0l.</p>
      <p>The Mitsubishi Triton took the runner-up spot, while the Nissan Navara grabbed third place.</p>
