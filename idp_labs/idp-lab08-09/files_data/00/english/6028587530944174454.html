      <p>SAS, the Scandinavian airline, just announced that the first of the three Airbus A321LR (Long Range) aircraft it is acquiring will enter service on September 18, 2020. The first plane is slated to fly between Boston and Copenhagen. All three new SAS A321LR aircraft should be operating in time for the summer 2021 season. As befits its name, the A321LR is a long-range twin jet that can fly over 4,000 miles, which gives airlines flexibility in creating new routes, In addition to the Northeast US, SAS says the range of the A321LR will also let it potentially serve destinations in Canada, the Middle East and India from Scandinavia.</p>
      <p>With Scandinavia a hotbed of climate change activism such as “<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/24/citi-flight-shaming-getting-traction-could-cost-airlines-billions.html">flight shaming</a>,” the fact that the new aircraft is expected to reduce climate-impacting emissions by 15-18 percent doesn’t hurt either.</p>
      <p>The first A321LR route, from Boston to Copenhagen, covers a distance of 3,670 miles over the Atlantic. SAS says this flight will become a year-round, high frequency route (6 times a week) as part of the airline’s plans to expand service to North America. If you want to lock up your chance to be one of the first to fly the new route, SAS says <a href="https://www.flysas.com/us-en/">website sales</a> will start Wednesday, November 20, 2019.</p>
      <p>Some might think that a nearly eight-hour flight in a narrow-bodied, single-aisle aircraft might not be te most comfortable experience. But while the A321LR is capable of <a href="https://apex.aero/2019/03/14/just-right-a321lr-goldilocks-aircraft">seating up to 206 i</a>n a two-seating class configuration, SAS says it is limiting seating to 157 in three classes. There will be 22 Business, 12 Plus and 123 Go seats. Despite the plane’s narrow-body design, it’s <a href="https://paxex.aero/2019/09/sas-a321lr-thompson-vantage-business-class-seat/">reported</a> that Business Class will include lie-flat seating.</p>

      <p>In addition to more space, those sitting in Business and Plus will have wider aisles as well as cabin dividers to separate their seating area from the rest of the aircraft. SAS promises that the cabin will also offer different types of “mood lighting” as well as hi-speed Wi-Fi, and reduced noise.</p>
      <p>The introduction of the A321LR “will allow us to offer travelers more intercontinental routes, less stopovers and shorter travel times to and from Scandinavia,” says Max Knagge, General Manager Americas at SAS. Knagge also believes that new-generation aircraft like the A321LR will also help reduce the airline industry’s carbon footprint. “SAS aims to lead the way toward sustainable travel. We have set a target of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 25 percent by 2030.”</p>
      <p>SAS currently carries more than 30 million passengers annually via its three main hubs, Copenhagen, Oslo and Stockholm. A Star Alliance member, the airline serves 125 destinations in Europe, the US and Asia.</p>
