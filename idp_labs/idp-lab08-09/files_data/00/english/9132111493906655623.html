      <p>The Kwahu West Municipal Assembly through its District Disability Fund Management Committee has provided income-generating items to 144 Persons With Disability in the municipality.</p>
      <p>This comes as a result of the government's pledge to increase the disability fund component of the District Assemblies Common Fund from two per cent to three per cent.</p>
      <p>The items presented to the PWDs include deep freezers, corn mills, gas ovens, sewing machines, plastic chairs, student mattresses, spraying machines, knitting and show grinding machines.</p>
      <p>Mr Yaw Owusu-Addo, the Municipal Chief Executive (MCE), who disclosed this during the assembly's meet-the-press forum held at Nkawkaw, said the gesture was to fulfil the promise made by President Akuffo-Addo during the 2016 election campaign.</p>
      <p>He said the empowerment of PWDs is a way to get them out of the streets and earn an economically rewarding occupation.</p>
      <p>The MCE urged the beneficiaries to make productive use of the items and reminded them that, there would be an intensive and regular monitoring exercise to see what they are doing with the support they received.</p>
      <p>Mr Owusu-Addo said the Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) programme in the Municipality has also made headway as a total of 1,458 households from 61 communities have been enrolled onto the programme.</p>
      <p>He said the assembly has registered over 200 beneficiaries under the National Health Insurance Scheme.</p>
      <p>This, he said, was to enable the LEAP beneficiary households access quality healthcare.</p>
      <p>He said that intensive monitoring would be instituted to ensure sustainability of the programme.</p>
