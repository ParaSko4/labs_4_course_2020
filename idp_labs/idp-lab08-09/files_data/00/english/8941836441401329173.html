      <p>SYDNEY (AP) - Australian actor <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/craig-mclachlan/">Craig McLachlan</a> kissed a female co-star’s neck, stomach and buttocks more than 20 times during a scene in a stage musical in which he was meant to merely simulate a sex act, a prosecutor told a court Monday.</p>
      <p>Details of allegations brought by four women against the former star of long-running Australian hit soap operas “Neighbours” and “Home and Away” were aired in the Melbourne Magistrates Court at a hearing expected to last three weeks.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/craig-mclachlan/">McLachlan</a>, 54, is facing multiple charges, including counts of indecent assault, one of attempted indecent assault and others of assault, involving the four complainants who worked with him in a production of “The Rocky Horror Show” in 2014. He won Australian theater’s prestigious Helpmann Award for best actor for the role.</p>
      <p>He denies the accusations by the four women, whose names cannot be published.</p>
      <p>Prosecution lawyer Matt Fisher alleged <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/craig-mclachlan/">McLachlan</a> “went beyond the role he was directed to perform” in relation to the allegations.</p>

      <p>He said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/craig-mclachlan/">McLachlan</a> assaulted one female co-star during the scene in which he was meant to be simulating a sex act, which took place out of sight of the audience.</p>
      <p>Aside from kissing her more than 20 times, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/craig-mclachlan/">McLachlan</a> had once use his finger to trace the outline of the woman’s genitals, Fisher told the court.</p>
      <p>“(The woman) felt as if she was trapped,” he said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/craig-mclachlan/">McLachlan</a> has also been accused of pushing his groin into the stomach area of another woman. He also kissed the woman during a show, without being directed to do so, forcing his tongue into her mouth.</p>

        <p>Fisher told the court the woman had allegedly said to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/craig-mclachlan/">McLachlan</a>: “Don’t you ever do that to me again.”</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/craig-mclachlan/">McLachlan</a> had allegedly replied: “Don’t you dare speak to me like that. You are nothing, I will end you.”</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/craig-mclachlan/">McLachlan</a>’s lawyer Stuart Littlemore will argue some of the alleged incidents didn’t occur, while others weren’t indecent.</p>
        <p>He said when <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/craig-mclachlan/">McLachlan</a> had given a woman an unexpected kiss on stage, he had the “license and discretion to ad lib.”</p>
        <p>The four alleged victims will give evidence about the incidents in a closed court.</p>
        <p>After the women’s allegations were published, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/craig-mclachlan/">McLachlan</a> initiated defamation proceedings against Fairfax Media, the Australian Broadcasting Corp., and a former co-star. That case has been delayed until after the criminal charges are resolved.</p>
