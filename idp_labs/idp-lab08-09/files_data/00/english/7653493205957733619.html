      <h1>Lenovo’s Smart Display 7 Lands In Oz</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.channelnews.com.au/author/jan-arreza/" target="_blank">Jan Arreza</a></address>
      <p>Two months since first announced, Lenovo’s Smart Display 7 with Google Assistant is now available in Australian shores with listings being made available on <a href="https://www.jbhifi.com.au/products/lenovo-smart-display-7-with-the-google-assistant"><u>JB Hi-Fi</u></a>, <a href="https://www.thegoodguys.com.au/lenovo-smart-display-7-with-google-assistant-za5k0001au"><u>The Good Guys</u></a> and <a href="https://www.harveynorman.com.au/lenovo-smart-display-7-with-the-google-assistant.html"><u>Harvey Norman</u></a> for $129.</p>
      <p>The latest 7-inch variant in Lenovo’s Smart Display series, the touch-enabled smart speaker makes a departure from the previous models by moving its display to above its speakers, as opposed to being on the side of them.</p>
      <p>The latest model comes with Wi-Fi 802.11ac, rather than Ethernet, to connect with a user’s other devices or smart home system.</p>
      <p>It has a 2MP camera just above the touchscreen in order to identify and recognise said users, although it can be covered using a physical shutter if desired.</p>
      <p>The Smart Display 7 also has an RGB sensor, which analyses the ambient colour of its surrounding décor so as to tune its screen output to match.</p>
      <p>As an additional incentive, Harvey Norman also has a pack, which includes the Smart Display 7, a Lenovo Smart Plug and Colour Changing Bulb for just $147.</p>
