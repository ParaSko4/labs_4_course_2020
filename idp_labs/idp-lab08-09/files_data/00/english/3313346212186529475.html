      <p>Logitech has created a new <a href="https://www.logitechg.com/en-gb/products/gamepads/adaptive-gaming-kit-accessories.html">'Adaptive Gaming Kit'</a> to help make the Xbox Adaptive Controller even more accessible by bundling accessories for the customizable controller together in a neat, $100 package.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/318288/Microsoft_launches_Xbox_Adaptive_Controller_to_make_games_more_accessible.php">Launched by Microsoft last year</a>, the Xbox Adaptive Controller is a unique slate-like gamepad that can be customized and reprogrammed to meet the specific needs of its user. The controller also features extensive support for third-party accessories and inputs, and that's where the Adaptive Gaming Kit comes in.</p>
      <p>Filled with useful accessories design to help Adaptive Controller owners make the most of the unique pad, the kit comes bundled with a collection of 12 high performance, durable buttons and triggers that can be arranged and attached as needed.</p>
      <p>More specifically, it includes four light touch buttons with a 12mm height that can be activated with low force, 2 variable pressure-sensitive triggers that can function like gas pedals, three small 1.4inch buttons that offer durable and consistent actuation, and three large 2.5-inch buttons that have been reinforced with stabilizer bars.</p>
      <p>To ensure each button is easy to position, label, and identify, Logitech is also throwing in some label sheets, hook and loop attachment stickers, hook and loop ties, and a couple of game boards.</p>
      <p>The full kit will cost $99.99, and should hopefully allow even more people to experience their favorite games in a way perfectly suited to them.</p>
