      <p><b>(NEW YORK POST)</b> —  A Florida woman allegedly bit her boyfriend’s penis and threatened him with a knife after she accused him of wanting to have sex with another woman, a report said.</p>
      <p>The alleged assault happened during an hours-long drinking session in Miami Beach that ended at about 3 a.m. Wednesday, a local NBC affiliate reported.</p>
      <p>Esperanza Gomez, 33, was drinking beers with her boyfriend when a female friend joined them at about midnight, according to the report.</p>
      <p>The friend left a short time later — but Gomez became enraged and accused her boyfriend of wanting to bed the woman.</p>
      <p>She allegedly shouted at him, grabbed him by the arms and “began to poke him with a knife,” according to a police report obtained by the station.</p>
      <p>She then “bit his penis out of frustration,” he later told police.</p>
      <p>Gomez was arrested and hit with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, according to county records.</p>
      <p>Her bond was set at $6,500.</p>
