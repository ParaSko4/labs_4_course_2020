      <p>Mars has launched a vegan version of the Galaxy bar in the UK. The vegan alternative Galaxy is available in three varieties: smooth orange, caramel and sea salt, and caramelised hazelnut.</p>
      <p>The vegan Galaxy will be available at Tesco stores from Monday 18 November and online soon after via Ocado and Amazon. The 100g bars have a RRP of £3.00.  </p>
      <p>Mars said the bars have been made by replacing the milk with rice syrup and hazelnut paste. Kerry Cavanaugh, Marketing Director at Mars Wrigley UK said: <i>“We're so excited to be bringing these delicious treats to Galaxy's range using a vegan recipe that doesn't compromise on the brand's signature smooth and creamy characteristics. Wherever you look you can’t avoid the vegan buzz in the UK - even though vegan treats are currently only worth £10m in a £4bn chocolate market, we think that by introducing Galaxy, one of the UK's best-known brands, there is huge opportunity for the category to grow.”</i>​</p>
      <p>Abigail Stevens, Trademark Marketing Manager at The Vegan Society added: <i>“We are delighted that Galaxy, such a well-known brand is entering the vegan market and offering more choice – and even more excited that there are three delicious flavours to choose from."</i>​</p>

      <p>Endo will launch what it calls the UK's first CBD infused sports drink at the International Drinks Exhibition at the London Excel 19/20 November 2019.</p>
      <p>With 10mg of CBD per 500ml bottle, Endo Sport can be taken as a pre- or post-workout drink, the company said. When taken before a workout, it delivers a boost of energy and increased focus to help get the customer through their gruelling session. After a workout, the anti-inflammatory properties of CBD get to work to help reduce post-exercise muscle soreness and speed up recovery.</p>
      <p>The drink, which comes in two flavours -- Orange and Berry &amp; Tropical – is designed to be used by both athletes and non-athletes during workouts. Pardeep Sooch, the founder of Endo Sport said: <i>“There has been a huge increase in the last year or so of the role that CBD can play in the sporting world. With a lot of well-known athletes from the worlds of rugby, MMA and the NFL coming out to support CBD, interest from amateur athletes and fitness enthusiasts has understandably been piqued.</i>​</p>
      <p><i>“English Rugby players James Haskell and George Kruis have both recently launched CBD sports supplements, so it looks like the industry is only going to keep getting bigger. Endo Sport fits naturally alongside these other brands, giving users a great-tasting sports drinking with the added benefit of CBD.”</i>​</p>

      <p>Griddle Pancake is launching in Sainsbury’s stores in the UK on November 20. Griddle Pancake makes American style pancakes made from only natural ingredients, 100% wholegrain, and with 50% less sugar.</p>
      <p>The Original Wholegrain and Lemon and Poppy Seed Pancakes will be heading into 100 Sainsbury’s stores throughout the country. It’s RRP is £2.80 and for a pack of six pancakes. A new Double-Choc Chip pancake as a well as a new vegan SKU are set to join line up throughout other retailers in early 2020.</p>
      <p>Griddle was founded by friends Ella Harland and Sophie McGregor who met through a flat-share in London. They said: <i>“Eating nutritious yet tasty food was a priority for both, however with hectic lifestyles and jobs it was often difficult to find the time to prepare good food! Pancakes were a firm favourite due to their versatility, but sadly only an option on the weekend when we had the time (and energy) to make them. We’d have loved to be able to buy them as part of a weekly shop, but all the pancakes on offer in the supermarkets simply weren’t up to scratch. Full of sugar, artificial colours, flavours and preservatives and simply lacking in any nutritional benefit. So that’s what Griddle’s here to change.</i>​</p>
      <p><i>“We’re on a mission to become the number one pancake brand. Because delicious pancakes shouldn’t have to come at the sacrifice of health and convenience.”</i>​</p>

      <p><i>“The taste of LaNana is unique, indefinable and a source of debate: sometimes acidulous, sometimes sweet, sometimes fruity ... A clever reflection of the power of pineapple.”</i>​</p>
