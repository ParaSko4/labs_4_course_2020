        <b>Dani Alves spoke to 'FOX Sports' and spoke about Argentina's last win in the friendly against Brazil. The Sao Paulo full-back recalled that, when it comes to official matches, Brazil usually win.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A 'Superclásico of the Americas' goes far beyond what a tournament or championship can mean. As in any derby, pride is at stake. In Brazil v Argentina or Argentina v Brazil it is the same.</p>
      <p>That's what <b>Dani Alves</b>, a player who has no qualms about talking about the most controversial issues, talked about. And the Brazilian wanted to dedicate a few words to Argentina after their 1-0 win in the last match.</p>
