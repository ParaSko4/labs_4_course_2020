      <p><b>Warren Bobrow=WB: Tell me about Cannabolish. What do you do? What is your role? </b>Dr. Laura Haupert=DLH: Cannabolish is our brand of plant-based odor control products scientifically developed to remove the odors associated with cannabis smoke. Cannabolish doesn’t mask the odors that come from cannabis smoke, but rather neutralizes it using plant oils and water – no added fragrances, no harmful ingredients. </p>
      <p>I’m the Director of Research and Development for OMI Industries, the leading manufacturer of plant-based odor control technologies for all walks of life. OMI specializes in odor control, from asphalt plants and wastewater treatment facilities to hospitals and hotels to litter boxes and minivans. I get to use my chemistry background to guide me toward innovative odor control solutions, and I have the unique opportunity to develop new technologies in the laboratory that provide odor control while improving quality of life for industries and consumers everywhere. </p>

        <b>WB: Why cannabis? When did you discover our plant? </b>
      </p>
      <p>DLH: Cannabis is a fascinating plant! From a scientific point of view, there is so much to learn about cannabis, from best growing techniques, to what each strain of cannabis can do and the chemical composition of the odors. When you grow cannabis, it emits a natural odor, just like a pine tree does. As you grow each strain of cannabis, what happens to the odor? Does the chemical composition of these odors change with each strain of cannabis? What is the best method to test these odors? These are the types of questions that are still being studied.</p>
      <p>For my career, I discovered the chemical odorous attributes of both growing cannabis and cannabis smoke when I first started working with OMI Industries in 2012. Since then, I have scientifically developed a formulation called Ecosorb CNB 100 that neutralizes the cannabis growing odors, as well as the Cannabolish formulation to remove the odors from cannabis smoke. Cannabis grow odors and cannabis smoke odors have completely different chemical compositions, so the odor control formulations have to be different. However, all of these formulations use natural plant oils to neutralize the malodors. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>WB: What is your six-month goal? Twelve months? What kind of obstacles do you face? </b>
      </p>
      <p>DLH: Day to day, my job is never the same — I never know what types of odor obstacles are coming my way. As the stigma around cannabis changes and the understanding of cannabis changes, new opportunities will come my way and I welcome it. Developing new formulations to help a worker at a greenhouse, the neighbor next to the greenhouse, the casual smoker, or to assist medical patients in having a better life through odor control is a thrill. I look forward in the next year to kicking odor in the face!</p>

        <b>WB: I read that Cannabolish was recently implemented by the nation's first consumption lounge, Lowell Cafe. How did that come about? </b>
      </p>
      <p>DLH: The purveyors of Lowell Café became familiar with our Ecosorb work with California growers who implemented our chemistry through custom-built vapor phase delivery equipment – the whole point was to help those growers to be better neighbors to the surrounding community, and Lowell Cafe wants to do the same. Lowell Cafe is utilizing three of our 50 cfm vapor phase units that are made of 14-gauge powder coated steel. These units are self-contained and only need power to operate. The 50 cfm vapor phase units utilized our Cannabolish Odor Removing Liquid. The units vaporize the Cannabolish spray into the air around the perimeter of the café producing droplets of Cannabolish. </p>
      <p>Cannabolish works by first adsorbing the odor molecule to the Cannabolish droplet. Since the Cannabolish spray is vaporized around the perimeter of the café, it comes in contact with the smoke as soon as it is produced. This is a key to Cannabolish products, they have to come in contact with the source of the odor. Next, the Cannabolish droplet absorbs the odor molecule into the droplet. Once the odor molecule is in the droplet, the odor is under control. In addition, simple acid/base reactions can take place between the odors and the Cannabolish resulting in neutralization. This simple yet complex solution results in odor control of cannabis smoke. </p>
      <p>
        <b>WB: What makes Cannabolish different from other products on the market?</b>
      </p>
      <p>DLH: For starters… it works! Cannabolish was scientifically formulated to remove the odorous chemicals in cannabis smoke using natural plant oils as the active ingredients – we’re fighting terpenes with terpenes, so to speak. Similar to tobacco smoke, cannabis smoke is a complex mixture of odorous chemical compounds, including ammonia, carbonyl compounds, phenols, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In order to formulate Cannabolish, a chemical assessment was performed on cannabis smoke to determine chemical compounds and their concentrations and odor detection thresholds.</p>
      <p>Cannabolish uses plant oils that were selected based on their ability to neutralize the odorous chemicals found in cannabis smoke. Cannabolish is not a simple blend of one or two plant oils, but rather a mixture of many plant oils, each with a specific role in the neutralization of cannabis smoke. Through rigorous testing, the Cannabolish formulations were developed to be the best in the industry at neutralizing odors and improving the quality of life of those that use it. </p>
