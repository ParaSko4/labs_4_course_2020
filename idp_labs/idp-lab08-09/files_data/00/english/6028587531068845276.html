      <p>After Alabama dropped to No. 5 in the College Football Playoff <a href="https://collegefootballplayoff.com/rankings.aspx">rankings last week</a> after losing to what is now top-ranked LSU, there was much discussion about how the Crimson Tide could still reserve a spot in the final four.Now, the task for Nick Saban’s team is tougher after losing Heisman candidate Tua Tagovailoa to a season-ending, and likely collegiate career-ending, hip injury.</p>
      <p>While help will be required, particularly other one-loss teams on the playoff bubble becoming two-loss teams, a convincing Tide win at Auburn in the Iron Bowl with Mac Jones behind center may have to be the largest of the dominoes to fall in Alabama’s favor as they seek to overcome the odds of losing a quarterback who has thrown 87 touchdown passes against all of 11 interceptions in his career in Tuscaloosa.</p>
      <p>Certainly, Alabama has to help itself against a Tigers team that is 13th nationally and one spot behind the Crimson Tide in points allowed per game (17.8). Going against Derrick Brown, Nick Coe and the Auburn defense will be a stark contrast to the Arkansas team Jones faced in his previous start. </p>
      <p>The bottom line is Alabama, which hosts — <a href="https://fbschedules.com/alabama-host-western-carolina-2019/">and pays</a> — FCS member Western Carolina on Saturday, needs to impress before it can depend on others lending a hand. That said, the level of help the Tide needs is not of the improbable variety.</p>
      <p>One way or the other Texas A&amp;M will have much to say about how things shake down in the SEC and CFP. The Aggies travel to Athens on Saturday and head to Baton Rouge on Thanksgiving weekend, a week after the Tigers host Arkansas.</p>
      <p>Assuming the Tigers and Bulldogs do not suffer any damage, LSU would have to defeat Georgia in the conference championship. That would likely knock the two-loss Bulldogs, who also play Georgia Tech, entirely out of the playoff picture. An UGA win would seemingly hurt the Tide, given the latter’s head-to-head loss to LSU. </p>
      <p>The Tigers losing to the Aggies and then to Georgia in the conference championship game would really loosen things up above ‘Bama. Alas, that would be asking too much.</p>
      <p>Would a win by No. 9 Penn State at No. 2 Ohio State on Saturday be enough to lift the Nittany Lions past Alabama and into the top four? They would still have to defeat No. 8 Minnesota or Wisconsin — those two teams meet next week in Minny — in the Big 10 championship game.</p>
      <p>It could come down to one-loss Penn State, which closes the regular season with Rutgers whose best wins were on consecutive October Saturdays at Iowa and versus Michigan, or one-loss Alabama that would have Auburn as its best win. The Buckeyes can render all that moot on Saturday. (Or James Franklin’s team can beat the Ohio State and lose to current-two loss Wisconsin in the championship game, a scenario that would likely eliminate the Big Ten from the CFP.)</p>
      <p>Aforementioned Minnesota, should it get past the Badgers, would need to beat either Penn State or Ohio State in the Big Ten championship to remain in the CFP conversation and get in Alabama’s way. The quality of their wins, possibly including two against the Nittany Lions, would provide a strong argument for being included.</p>
      <p>How about No. 6 Oregon and No. 7 Utah, a pair of one-loss teams on course to meet for the Pac-12 title?</p>
      <p>The Ducks have been dominant in winning nine straight, though only one of the victories was against a team (currently unranked Washington) ranked at the time. There is also this not-too-small detail: Oregon’s only loss was the season opener against Auburn. Should the Tide win on The Plains, that would give them a win over a common and ranked opponent.</p>
      <p>An impressive win, and likely not <i>just</i> a win, over the Utes in the conference championship game would still provide Mario Cristobal’s team, which has to play at Arizona State before hosting Oregon State, with a good argument for making the CFP.</p>
      <p>Utah, which has remaining games at Arizona and versus Colorado, is facing similar scenario as Oregon. That is to say win out and hope for the best. However, the Utes’ non-conference slate lacked a Power Five opponent and their lone setback was to unranked USC.</p>
      <p>While the storybook version would have Alabama and Jones, who is replacing Tagovailoa, who replaced Jalen Hurts in the CFP championship game two years ago, meet up with Hurts and Oklahoma in the playoff, well, the No. 10 Sooners need much help even after their second-half uprising in Waco. </p>
      <p>OU, which allowed 123 points over a 10-quarter stretch before blanking Baylor in the second half of their comeback win, hosts TCU on Saturday before the annual showdown with ranked Oklahoma State in Stillwater. Then there is the Big 12 title game, which could mean another meeting with the Bears. It could be a tough trio of games, for sure, but neither is a top-10 opponent that would be needed to fuel a Sooner rise into the top four.</p>
      <p>While so much needs to be sorted out the next three Saturdays, Alabama in Tua’s absence should not be dismissed from playoff picture.</p>
