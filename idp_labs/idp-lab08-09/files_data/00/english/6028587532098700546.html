      <p><b>Zebra Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ: ZBRA)</b>, a company that manufactures and sells AIDC (Automatic Identification and Data Capture) products, including: mobile computers, barcode scanners, RFID (radio frequency identification device) readers, specialty printers for barcode labeling and personal identification, real-time location systems, etc., has seen its stock price rise by close to 25% over the last month, driven by stronger Q3 2019 results that beat estimates and with the company signing the largest deal in its history. The stock has reacted strongly with the company reporting earnings of $3.43 per share in Q3 2019, much ahead of analysts’ expectation of $3.28 per share. The company has now surpassed market expectations for 14 straight quarters. The company also unveiled a multiyear deal with the U.S. Postal Service, supplying 300,000 bar code readers in 2020 as the start of a broader partnership. The $570 million deal is the largest single deal in Zebra’s history.We ‘step back’ from these recent swings to review Zebra Technologies’ performance over the last few years, as a context for what might come next.
