      <p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-is-slurping-up-health-dataand-it-looks-totally-legal/">Google is accessing the health data of millions of Americans</a>, supposedly to develop algorithms able to diagnose some medical problems. What it is doing is legal, but has set off a privacy scare and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/behind-googles-project-nightingale-a-health-data-gold-mine-of-50-million-patients-11573571867">a federal inquiry</a> after an employee of the company wrote <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/14/im-the-google-whistleblower-the-medical-data-of-millions-of-americans-is-at-risk">an anonymous article in The Guardian</a> highlighting the lack of anonymity and concerns about the possible uses of the data in the future.Known internally as <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50404678">Project Nightingale</a>, the project involves some 250 employees from Google and from the health giant <a href="https://www.ascension.org/">Ascension</a>: Google has denied any wrongdoings or privacy violations stating that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-13/google-denies-it-s-using-ascension-s-health-data-for-ai-research">the company is just building a new internal search tool for the Ascension hospital network and that no patient data is being used for Google’s artificial intelligence research</a>. This is an extremely interesting project, but one that requires strict privacy protections. Google’s parent company, Alphabet, which also works on health-related issues through its companies <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calico_%28company%29">Calico</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verily">Verily</a>, and that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/enriquedans/2019/10/29/alphabet-and-fitbit-could-this-be-the-competition-the-wearables-segment-has-been-waitingfor/#79ead21d1f0d">recently acquired Fitbit</a>, is not the only technology company interested in data collection and its analysis: <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/12/apple-has-dozens-of-doctors-on-staff.html">Apple has been hiring doctors for some time</a> and <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/appleheartstudy.html">working with Stanford University</a> to develop <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1901183?query=featured_cardiology">macro-studies</a> with almost half a million users using heart rate data provided by their Apple Watches; <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/amazon-transforming-healthcare/">Amazon also seems to have set its sights on the healthcare market</a>.</p>
      <p>These types of studies, which combine machine learning and the obvious expertise of these companies to handle mass health data, are <a href="https://medium.com/enrique-dans/reinventing-medical-research-baa1b24bd443">a new frontier in the field of medicine</a>, where studies are much less ambitious and typically involve much lower amounts of data, while offering the possibility of great advances for society. That said, concerns are justified if the studies take place under conditions that allow, by action or omission, the health data of its participants to be exposed or used for purposes other than originally established, or if people are not allowed to opt out, as seems to be the case.</p>
      <p>Most of us are happy to make a contribution toward medical science, whether out of self interest or for more altruistic reasons. But that does not imply that studies like Google’s should not be subject to rigid controls or absolute transparency. The end does not justify the means.</p>
      <p>At the same time, we need to take into account the reputation of some technology companies with regard to the processing of personal data, and the concerns that might raise among those taking part in such projects. Participants must have the opportunity to freely decide if they want their data to be included or not, and to do so clearly and unequivocally, without having to navigate confusing forms that grant unlimited permits or signed consents in the absence of clear information. Only in this way will we be able to advance in an enormously promising discipline that can contribute greatly to the well-being of humanity, but which cannot and should not be developed in secret.</p>
      <p>Perhaps one answer would be for this type of research to take place in a completely open source environment, in which all companies are obliged to collaborate, with anonymized but public and shared data sets, rather than with companies competing to capture more data and to be the first to be able to bring their services to market: if open source has proven to be the most dynamic development environment that we have been able to create, we should possibly rethink what kind of conditions we want to generate for something as important as understanding the science that helps us improve our health.</p>
