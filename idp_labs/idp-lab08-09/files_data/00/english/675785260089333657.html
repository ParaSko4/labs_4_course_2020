      <p>He isn't the only Beckham boy being linked with a bit of romance.</p>
      <p>Brother Brooklyn is not hanging about when it comes to finding a new beau as he has been linked with his fourth woman in as many months as he looks for 'the one'.</p>
      <p>He has gone 'official' with 24-year-old Marvel actress Nicola Peltz.</p>
      <p>"Brooklyn has already met her family and he gets on very well with her brother, they even partied together," a source told The Sun.</p>

      <p>"He is becoming quite prolific in his wooing. He has obviously inherited his dad’s charm.</p>
      <p>"He’s not naturally the most ­gregarious of boys, but his success rate with girls is quite astonishing. His pals egg him on but David and Victoria are less impressed."</p>
