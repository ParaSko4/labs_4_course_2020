      <p>Valve's Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/valvesoftware/status/1196566870360387584">has confirmed the existence of <i>Half-Life: </i><i>Aly</i>x</a>, a new SteamVR game being developed in-house.</p>
      <p>15 years after the Seattle-based company released the critically-acclaimed <i>Half-Life 2 </i>(the game was first released in 2004, <i>Episode 2</i> launched in 2007 with <i>The Orange Box</i>), the company appears poised to return to the sci-fi franchise as a vehicle to push its own VR platform.</p>
      <p>This announcement is somewhat notable both because it runs counter to Valve's infamous secrecy and because the company has slowed down its game development to a near-crawl of late.</p>
      <p>The name <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> also appears to imply a focus on <i>Half-Life 2's</i> supporting character Alyx Vance.</p>
      <p>It's not 100 percent clear which headsets will be supported by the <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> developers. While the Valve Index is no doubt on the list, the company <a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/349692/Viveport_Infinity_rolls_out_support_for_the_Valve_Index.php">does have a standing partnership with Viveport</a> that may indicate support for the HTC Vive as well.</p>

      <p>More details on <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> will be revealed on November 21st at 10AM PT.</p>
