      <p>Perhaps the headline should have come with a spoiler alert for those who are waiting patiently for the Deloitte Money League to be published in January. But with Real Madrid, Barcelona, Manchester United, and Bayern Munich (2019’s top 4) having announced financial results we already know that for the first time, Barcelona is going to top the money league come 2020. Barcelona’s revenue grew from €690M in 2018 to €852M for 2019. Some of you will notice that €852M falls short of the €990M announced by the club but Barcelona included revenue from transfers and accounting adjustments as part of the €990M - something that is not included in Deloitte’s revenue calculation.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, the “real” increase of $162M is mighty impressive with the biggest gains being made in the areas of Broadcasting and Marketing.</p>
      <p>The revenue increase saw Barcelona shoot past a rather stagnant Real Madrid. Real’s revenue increased by just €6M from €751 to €757. This means that Barcelona has gone from €60M behind to €95M ahead in just 12 months.</p>
      <p>Of course, the financial health of any business can’t be judged solely on one metric. Here are some other comparisons that show that although Barcelona will top the next Deloitte Financial Football League, Real Madrid is in far better financial health.</p>
      <p><b>EBITDA</b> (Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization): Barcelona €72M; Real Madrid €124M - advantage Real Madrid</p>
      <p><b>Profit after tax</b>: Barcelona €5M; Real Madrid €38M - advantage Real Madrid</p>
      <p><b>Net Debt</b>: Barcelona - €217M; Real Madrid (€27M) - advantage Real Madrid (Yes, Real has negative debt)</p>
      <p><b>Gains on player transfers</b>: Barcelona €101M; Real Madrid €98.5M - advantage Barcelona</p>

      <p><b>Amortization of players contracts</b>: Barcelona €146M; Real Madrid €104M - advantage Real Madrid</p>
      <p><b>Soccer wages</b>: Barcelona €501M; Real Madrid €362M - advantage, I’ll let you decide.</p>
      <p><b>Other expenses</b>: Barcelona €238M; Real Madrid €239M - a draw.</p>
      <p>For those of you looking to do some light reading you can peruse the extensive 2019 annual reports provided by <a href="https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/club/organisation-and-strategic-plan/commissions-and-bodies/annual-reports">Barcelona</a> and <a href="https://www.realmadrid.com/en/members/member-card/annual-reports">Real Madrid</a>.</p>

        <b>Manchester United and Bayern Munich</b>
      </p>
      <p>Manchester United and Bayern Munich finished 3rd and 4th in the 2019 Deloitte Football Money League and they can expect to occupy the same positions come the publication of the 2020 report.</p>
      <p>Manchester United’s turnover will be impacted by the exchange rate as Brexit has driven the pound down in value over the last couple of years. If a rate of 1.17 is used then Manchester United’s 2019 revenue will come in at €732M. Measured in UK Pounds Manchester United’s revenue grew by 6% from 2018 to 2019.</p>
      <p>As for Bayern Munich, the German team has taken a leaf from Barcelona’s book and the announced revenue of €750M for 2019 includes revenue from transfers of close to €100m.</p>
      <p>After deducting the transfer revenue Bayern will almost certainly hold on to 4th spot with “apples-to-apples” revenue of €652M - an increase of €23m or 3.6% from the previous year.</p>
      <p>Some reports have suggested that Bayern’s announced €750M (that is actually €650M) might be enough to see the team leapfrog into 2nd. That’s not going to happen.</p>
