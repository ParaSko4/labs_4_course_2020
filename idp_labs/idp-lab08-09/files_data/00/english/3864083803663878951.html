      <p>11/15/18 Phoenix, AZ: <b>Adventure Fitness</b> (<a href="http://adv.fit/">http://adv.fit</a>), a North Valley AZ-based event company specializing in obstacle course adventures for school fundraisers, corporate team building, and university challenges welcomes longtime friend and associate Mark Ballas's <b>Green Beret Challenge</b> as a partner to expand Adventure Fitness offerings on a national scale.</p>
      <blockquote><i>“Over the past four years, Adventure Fitness has exploded from a few events in Phoenix to challenges of all shapes and sizes across the USA. With Mark’s vast experience in the world of obstacle course racing through creating the wildly successful <b>Green Beret Challenge</b> we’re now able to expand our event production to more locations while increasing the scope of events that we can offer.” </i>says<i> </i>Brett Stewart co-founder of Adventure Fitness.</blockquote>
      <p>This announcement comes just days after Adventure Fitness hosted <b>Arizona State University’s “Gold Rush” </b>Family Weekend obstacle course event on-campus on Tempe, AZ and just a short time before their upcoming <b>Ninja Kid’s Camp</b> in Peoria, AZ over Thanksgiving break.</p>

      <blockquote><i>Stewart continued: “For two “OG’s” of the obstacle course racing world to get to pair up like this is fantastic; I wrote the first book on the sport back in 2012 (</i>Ultimate Obstacle Race Training<i>) and Green Beret Challenge was the first challenge of its type in the sport of OCR. Mark’s Special Forces background is an integral part on how he goes about building the types of courses he offers, the challenges he provides for athletes young &amp; old, and the importance of developing teamwork to complete important tasks with important deadlines. For us to bring this hands-on knowledge to schools, universities, and corporate clients is unprecedented!”</i></blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <i>Mark, founder and CEO of Green Beret Challenge, stated, “Brett and I have been working together on various OCR championships throughout the past 4 years. We are super stoked to have been selected to partner with Brett &amp; Kristen. It is a rare opportunity when 2 very seasoned RD’s in this very competitive OCR industry are given chance to combine efforts towards a common goal”.</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>ADV.FIT and GBC’s events are customized for each client; school fundraisers, corporate challenges, and collegiate athletics each have their own branding<i> </i>(ASU’s <i>Gold Rush</i>, NAU’s <i>AXE Factor</i>, MINDBODY’s <i>Ignite</i>, etc.) while retaining the elements of Adventure Fitness’ obstacle courses such as cargo nets, monkey bars, rope walls, Wreck Bags, and adding challenges such as Green Beret Challenge’s sled drag, crawls, climbs, and much more to create a dynamic event to foster team building as well as individual empowerment.</p>
      <p><b>About Adventure Fitness:</b> Based in Phoenix, AZ, Brett and Kristen Stewart created Adventure Fitness to promote healthy, fun, active events at schools around the North Valley. Based on their background in event production with over 12 years experience hosting triathlons, road races, adventure runs, and more, ADV.FIT quickly expanded to cover charity events, corporate team-building challenges, university athletics, and event production for outside companies such as the OCR World Championships, North American OCR Championships, etc. More information can be found online at <a href="http://adv.fit/">http://adv.fit</a></p>
