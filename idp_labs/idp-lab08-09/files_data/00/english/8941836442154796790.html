        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marie-yovanovitch/">Marie Yovanovitch</a>, former U.S. ambassador to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>, may have had her day in Congress, telling a friendly House Intelligence Chairman <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-schiff/">Adam Schiff</a> all about the devastating humiliation she suffered when President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> pulled her from her post — something, by the way, that’s regularly done to diplomats serving during change-of-administration times.</p>
      <p>And she may taken her pot shots at Rudy <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/giuliani/">Giuliani</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>’s personal attorney, by accusing that he headed the smear campaign against her character that led to her loss of cushy job.</p>
      <p>But that smoke has cleared and a new day has dawned. And <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/giuliani/">Giuliani</a>, in an interview with One America News, <a href="https://twitter.com/chanelrion?s=11">made</a> clear: <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marie-yovanovitch/">Yovanovitch</a> is hardly a poor suffering nonpartisan soul.</p>
      <p>“There are at least five Ukrainian officials who are willing to testify against her, not anonymously, like their whistleblower, not hearsay, like their first two witnesses — this may be hard for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-schiff/">Adam Schiff</a> to take — but they would actually give real testimony. And what they would say basically is that she was very, very pro-Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/giuliani/">Giuliani</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3LHd5IcjpQ">said</a>.</p>
      <p>That’s interesting because <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marie-yovanovitch/">Yovanovitch</a>, in her own testimony, acknowledged that it wasn’t a proper diplomat role to sway elections.</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>But that’s interesting, too, because of what <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/giuliani/">Giuliani</a> went on to say.</p>
      <p>“There are five witnesses who say that she instructed the prosecutor general of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> to dismiss four cases,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/ChanelRion/status/1196184617977622530">said</a>, to OAN’s White House correspondent, Chanel Rion. “Two of those cases involved Ukrainian collusion with Democrats to hurt <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a>. One of them involved a company owned by George Soros. There are five witnesses who are willing to testify to that. None of them were called. None of them were interviewed.”</p>
      <p>Where are those witnesses?</p>
      <p>Not on <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-schiff/">Schiff</a>’s list, apparently.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>Here’s what the media wants the takeaway from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marie-yovanovitch/">Yovanovitch</a>’s testimony to be: “Ousted ambassador says she felt intimidated by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> attacks,” The Star Tribune <a href="http://www.startribune.com/ousted-us-ambassador-to-testify-in-trump-impeachment-probe/564966642/">wrote</a> in a headline.</p>
        <p>“<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> attacks ambassador as she testifies that his words in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> call made her feel threatened,” CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/15/trump-attacks-ambassador-as-she-testifies-in-impeachment-hearing.html">wrote</a>.</p>
        <p>“Ex-Envoy to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> ‘Devastated’ as Trump Vilified Her,” The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/us/politics/marie-yovanovitch-testimony.html">wrote</a>.</p>
        <p>But if what <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/giuliani/">Giuliani</a> says is true — and honestly, that’d be a fairly easy vetting to make; Democrats need only call forward these five witnesses to publicly testify — then it’s not just <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marie-yovanovitch/">Yovanovitch</a>’s character that will be called into question.</p>
        <p>It’s the validity of the whole Democrat-pressed impeachment inquiry into <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>’s <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> call.</p>
        <p>After all, if one of the Democrats’ leading, opening, star witnesses in a case alleging <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>’s guilt of “bribery” — an impeachable offense — is shown to be a pro-Hillary Clinton anti-Trumping force, imagine how the rest of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-schiff/">Schiff</a>’s witnesses, the Tier Two witnesses set to speak this week, will crumble.</p>
