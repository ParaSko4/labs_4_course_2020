      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Jamie Wareham</a></address>
      <p>331 trans and gender diverse people have been killed this year, says a new report.The majority of the murders catalogued happened in Brazil, totalling 130. However, Mexico had 63, and the United States saw 30. </p>
      <p>Only one was counted in the United Kingdom this year. Across Europe, nine trans people were killed, <a href="https://transrespect.org/en/tmm-update-trans-day-of-remembrance-2019/">according to the report</a>.</p>
      <p>The annual report released to mark the International Trans Day of Remembrance, held annually on November 20, is compiled by Transrespect versus Transphobia Worldwide.</p>
      <p>The Trans Murder Monitoring report has been released every year since 2008. Since the project began 11 years ago, they have recorded 3314 deaths. It monitors homicides that happen every year between the dates of between October 1 and September 30.</p>
      <p>This year the number of deaths is down slightly from 2018’s 369, to 331 this year. </p>

      <h3>The report is released annually to mark Transgender Day of Remembrance</h3>
      <p>The list, compiled by Transrespect versus Transphobia Worldwide, sources local and national news stories covering the deaths and murders. </p>
      <p>The stories from across the world share gruesome details of the homicides, hangings and even lynching of trans and gender diverse people.</p>
      <p>The report authors say: "Stigma and discrimination against trans and gender-diverse people is real and profound around the world."</p>
      <p>Since the Trans Murder Monitoring project began in 2008, 61% of the deaths have been in the sex workers community. 1 in 3 killed have been shot. </p>
      <p>The report acknowledges the actual number of trans people killed is likely to be much higher than they can catalogue:</p>
      <p>"In most countries, data on murdered trans and gender-diverse people are not systematically produced, and it is impossible to estimate the actual number of cases.</p>
      <p>"Trans and gender-diverse people are victims of horrifying hate violence, including extortion, physical and sexual assaults, and murder."</p>
