      <p>This is how the Black Stars were rated in their 1-0 win over Sao Tome in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers on Monday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Richard Ofori</p>
      <p>Virtually on holiday as Sao Tomé couldn't trouble him in posts. 6/10</p>
      <p>Andy Yiadom</p>
      <p>Good support for Owusu on few occasions, but he should have been high up the pitch to provide some crosses. 6/10</p>
      <p>Joseph Aidoo</p>
      <p>Not the best of performance but he was well composed with no chance for striker Luis Leal to threat Ghana. 7/10</p>
      <p>Kassim Nuhu Adams</p>
      <p>Just like his partner Aidoo he was composed, calm and resilient throughout the game. 7/10</p>
      <p>Gideon Mensah</p>
      <p>Gave the Black Stars width and control in first half with some great runs on the left in only his second appearance. 7/10</p>
      <p>Iddrisu Baba</p>
      <p>Struggle a bit in midfield but he was okay overall. 5/10</p>
      <p>Thomas Partey</p>
      <p>It was in-out performance from the Atletico Madrid star, made couple of decent passes and also gave away some passes. 5.5/10</p>
      <p>Andre Ayew</p>
      <p>Had little impact in game. He was way off his best in the second half. 5/10</p>
      <p>Samuel Owusu</p>
      <p>Couple of moments of great skills, but also mixed in some sloppy delivery and pointless passing - not close to his best. 6/10</p>
      <p>Emmanuel Boateng</p>
      <p>Didn't put the best of performance but managed to win a penalty for Ghana. 5/10</p>
      <p>Jordan Ayew</p>
      <p>Made it 15 goals in Ghana colours with one from the spot to give the Black Stars the victory. 6/10</p>
      <p>Substitutes:</p>
      <p>Christopher Antwi-Adjei</p>
      <p>Had some pretty runs when he came on. He was able to provide one threatening cross. 6/10</p>
      <p>Kudus Mohammed</p>
      <p>Not much time on the field to rate him.</p>
      <p>Joseph Attamah Larweh</p>
      <p>No rating as he spent less than five months on the pitch.</p>
