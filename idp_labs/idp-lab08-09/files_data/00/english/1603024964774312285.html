      <p>The funds will be used to augment the company's technology capabilities and supply chain infrastructure, as well as to build its team strength. The company is currently focussed on optimising its fulfillment capabilities for better delivery management, especially across tier 2 and tier 3 cities and rural areas.</p>
      <p>The company said the funding is in line with its plans for rapid expansion and product diversification, with a target of $100 million in revenue and five times the growth by the end of the current financial year.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the funding, Vivek Tiwari, Founder and CEO, Medikabazaar, said, "We are aiming to secure 10 percent of the organised market share by 2025 and will continue to channel our efforts towards this goal, with a key focus on smaller cities and remote areas."</p>
      <p>He added that the current investment will help grow the company's distribution footprint across India.</p>
      <p>Medikabazaar currently has 17 fulfillment centres across the country.</p>
