      <h3>U.S. EPA Celebrates WIFIA Project</h3>
      <p>The U.S. EPA and the Orange County Water District (OCWD) participated in a groundbreaking ceremony for the Groundwater Replenishment System (GWRS) Final Expansion in Orange County, Calif. The project is funded in part by a $135 million Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) loan, <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/us-epa-celebrates-wifia-project-groundbreaking-orange-county-water-district">according to an EPA press release</a>.</p>
      <p>“Not only will OCWD’s Groundwater Replenishment System provide Orange County residents and businesses with an additional local drinking water supply, it will also ensure the community is more resilient against periods of drought,” <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/us-epa-celebrates-wifia-project-groundbreaking-orange-county-water-district">said EPA Pacific Southwest Regional Administrator Mike Stoker</a>. “Good water quality and wastewater management is vital to our health, communities, and economy. Through the WIFIA loan program, EPA is helping renew our nation’s aging water infrastructure.”</p>
      <p>“The GWRS Final Expansion will produce enough water for 1 million people, while also recycling 100% of the reclaimable wastewater from the Sanitation District,” said OCWD President Vicente Sarmiento. “It’s truly a win-win and we will continue to implement projects and programs that bring increased water reliability to the region.”</p>
