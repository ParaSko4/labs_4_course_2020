      <p>Cliff Parisi will reportedly become the 12th star to join <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! 2019</a>, after being revealed as the secret late arrival hoping to gatecrash the camp.</p>
      <p>Cliff is best known for playing the iconic role of Minty Peterson on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tv-soaps/eastenders/">Eastenders</a> from 2002-2010, while also making appearances in Hollyoaks and Casualty over the years.</p>
      <p>However, since 2012 the actor has starred as Fred Buckle, a handyman, in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/call-the-midwife/">Call the Midwife</a> where he’s worked alongside stars such as Miranda Hart, Helen George and Miriam Margolyes.</p>
      <p>Cliff will enter the jungle alongside <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/im-celebrity-2019-line-mystery-solved-andrew-whyment-entering-jungle-not-alone-11124477/">previously revealed latecomer Coronation Street’s Andrew Whyment</a>, with the two soap stars dropping in just as our campmates are getting settled.</p>
      <p>Let the games begin!</p>
      <p>‘With Cliff and Andy we have got two big soap names joining the jungle and they’ll be a lot of fun,’ an ITV source told the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/breaking-secret-12th-im-celebrity-20902767">Daily Mirror</a>.</p>

      <p>‘Cliff is the final piece in the puzzle and comes from two massive BBC shows. It will be interesting to see if he sees the funny side of things when he has been in there a while and the hunger and tiredness kicks in.’</p>

      <p>Metro.co.uk understands that ITV will reveal their late arrivals next week, so keep your eyes peeled!</p>
      <p>The two actors will join a camp that has already been through a lot, after the opening episode saw the contestant face bugs, sweat <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/ant-dec-open-im-celebrity-hilarious-prince-andrew-sweat-dig-11172692/">(if it’s medically possible, some people can’t</a>) and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/im-a-celebritys-nadine-coyle-in-tears-as-shes-comforted-by-caitlyn-jenner-over-skydiving-challenge-11168416/">tears</a>.</p>
      <p>This is only day one; we’ve still got three more weeks of this!</p>
      <p>With the stars taking part being your normal, fairly impressive bunch of UK reality contestants and celebs, the one figure that sticks out among the group is the infinitely more famous <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a>.</p>
      <p>A shock signing for the show, with producers reportedly paying half a million for her (although <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/im-celebrity-ant-dec-make-digs-caitlyn-jenners-rumoured-500k-fee-11172629/">Ant and Dec aren’t a fan of that rumour</a>), Kendall and Kylie’s parent has lived a life in the US, meaning that she’s pretty removed from UK culture.</p>
      <p>So it’ll come as no surprise to know that Caitlyn was not exactly au fait with Britain’s reality TV talent pool as she was forced to admit that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/im-celebrity-awkwardness-caitlyn-jenner-admits-doesnt-know-uk-celebs-11172779/">she had no idea who her fellow campmates were</a>.</p>

      <p>Introducing herself to radio DJs Roman Kemp and Adele Roberts, soap star Jacqueline Jossa and comedian Andrew Maxwell, Jacqueline Jacqueline got to the point with a simple comment of: ‘You have no clue who anyone is.</p>
      <p>‘No I don’t,’ Caitlyn admitted, ‘but we’re gonna have a lot of time to talk.’</p>
      <p>Now that’s what we like to hear.</p>
