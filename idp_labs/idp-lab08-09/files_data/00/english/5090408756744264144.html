      <p>The New England Patriots went deep in their playbook to open the third quarter and score their first touchdown of the game vs. the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Trailing the Eagles, 10-9, to begin the second half, the Patriots used eight plays to march down to the Eagles’ 15-yard line. On 3rd-and-11, Tom Brady threw a short backwards pass to the right to Julian Edelman, who then tossed gorgeous ball to Phillip Dorsett in the end zone for the score.</p>
      <p>Watch the play below:</p>

      <p>The Patriots moved the score to 17-10 with a two-point conversion on a James White run.</p>
      <p>The Patriots offense was stagnant in the first half, as Brady set a career-high for incompletions in a half with 14. With the Eagles defense stifling them, the Patriots got clever to finally get in the end zone and take the lead.</p>
      <p>It helps, then, to have a quarterback-turned-receiver on the roster in Edelman.</p>
