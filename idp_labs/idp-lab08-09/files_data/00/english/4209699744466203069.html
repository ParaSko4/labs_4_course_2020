      <p>Former President of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo, has said that except Nigerians stay together, the country would be devoured. </p>
      <p>He said this at the 64th annual national convention of the Foursquare Gospel Church in Nigeria held at the church's campground in Ajebo, Ogun State.</p>
      <p>He also called on all Christians to emulate the ways of Jesus Christ and speak up against the challenges in the country. </p>
      <p>He said, “As Christians, we have to be like Christ as we are transformed into the likeness of Christ or little like Christ.</p>
      <p>“So, in all positions, situations, and events, we should be guided.</p>
      <p>“If Christ was in this position, in this situation or in this event, what would he have done?</p>
      <p>“We have a lot to do in the situation we found ourselves in this country today. And make no mistake about it, if we don’t get together and stay together, we would be devoured and that we should not take lightly.</p>
      <p>“For me, if Christ was in Nigeria today, He would not keep quiet. He would say it as it should be said. He would speak truth to power. He would have no fear and He would have no intimidation.</p>
      <p>“Children of God, you have a responsibility to do and say what Jesus Christ would have done and said if He was in Nigeria today.”</p>
