      <h1>Disappointing Start To The Dubai Airshow As Just Two Jets Are Ordered On Day One</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">James Asquith</a></address>
      <p>As I landed at Dubai International Airport last night, I was in awe of the sheer amount of aircraft and activity at one of the world’s busiest hubs. From a basic regional airstrip in the early 1990s, Dubai has truly become one of the world’s leading airports, with Emirates wide-body aircraft lined up wingtip to wingtip everywhere you look around the airfield.</p>

      <p>With 277 wide-body aircraft in Emirates’ fleet, mainly comprised of the largest commercial aircraft from Boeing and Airbus, the 777-300 and A380 respectively, the focus leading up to the biennial airshow has been Emirates’ fleet renewal plans.</p>
      <p>The first day of the airshow this year led to no major big-ticket orders. The only order seen was for two 787-9 Dreamliner from Biman Bangladesh Airlines. When compared to the first day of the airshow in 2013 and 2017, which is held at Al Maktoum international airport, the first day of sales looks rather paltry and maybe a greater reflection of headwinds facing the growth of middle-eastern airlines.</p>

        <figcaption>How will Emirates replace its huge fleet of A380 double-decker super jumbo aircraft? The airline has ... [+] already ordered the A330neo and A350.<cite>Getty Images</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>In 2013 there was a staggering $192 billion of aircraft orders on the first day and in 2017, when the airshow was last held, there was still an impressive $15 billion of orders on day one.</p>
      <p>With A380 production ending in 2021 and the new 777x now experiencing a delay to commercial service until 2021, the focus remains on the region’s largest carrier’s fleet renewal plans. The A380 and 777 make up almost the entire emirates fleet. However, the UAE-based carrier already placed a $15.1 billion order for 40 787-10 jets on day one of the airshow in 2017 and having 150 777x aircraft on their order-book, the question will be whether Emirates actually need to bulk order further aircraft at this year’s airshow that runs until November 21.</p>
      <p>Emirates have also recently ordered $21.4 billion of Airbus A330neo and A350 aircraft to partially replace some of their older A380 aircraft. With such a large order book, we should not be expecting any major orders from Emirates during the airshow. The other major UAE carrier, Etihad, has seen losses of $4.75 billion over the last four years, and with their new A350 deliveries being sent straight to storage, it seems as though the Abu Dhabi carrier won’t be looking to add any aircraft en-mass either this year.</p>

      <p>With airframes seeing extended lifelines, the days of bumper airshow orders from the Middle Eastern carriers may be a thing of the past, at least in the near term.</p>
      <p>The one rumour of a major order which may materialise in the next few days is from the UAE low-cost carrier Air Arabia, who could place an order for up to 100 aircraft from either Airbus or Boeing. Air Arabia currently operates a fleet of A320 aircraft, however, with Boeing looking to potentially offer large discounts on the 737 MAX as the aircraft aims to return to commercial service early in 2020, the Seattle-based manufacturer could be a contender for a large order. We recently saw a mammoth order of 200 737 MAX aircraft from IAG, which would have undoubtedly been offered at a huge discount to list prices.</p>

      <p>Aircraft manufacturers tend to offer discounts for large orders, but with the negative PR that Boeing has received around the 737 MAX after two fatal crashes and its current subsequent worldwide grounding, Boeing will be anxious to put the plane firmly back on the map. This is compounded even more so due to the fact that many airlines have cancelled MAX orders after the grounding and unreliability of the aircraft.</p>
      <p>Boeing will likely be using their presence at the airshow to shore-up concerns with their 737 MAX rather than expecting any large orders of their own. With the manufacturer taking a $4.9 billion hit in Q2 for the grounded aircraft and seeing a plethora of compensation claims around the world from airlines who operate the jet, Boeing will be looking to re-establish customer and passenger confidence, as they look to re-enter the aircraft into service in the new year. Fly Dubai is one of the customers in the region that has been affected by the grounding.</p>

      <p>With 165 aircraft on display at the airshow and an estimated 80,000 visitors, these are early days for this year’s event, however, it doesn’t look like we will see the gargantuan orders of recent years.</p>
