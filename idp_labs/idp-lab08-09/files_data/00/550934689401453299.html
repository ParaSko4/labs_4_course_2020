      <h4>Technological advances and digital games have always influenced each other, with new genres coming and going all the time. Cloud gaming, a streaming service, is the latest development.</h4>

          <figcaption>From pixels to virtual reality<br/><b>Lines, dots, spaceships<br/></b>Long before video games entered living rooms and kid's bedrooms, they were found at universities and demonstrated what powerful computers were capable of. The game Spacewar! from 1962 was one of the very first computer games, developed by computer scientist Steve Russel, in collaboration with Martin Graetz and Wayne Wiitanen, at the renowned Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>From pixels to virtual reality<br/><b>Playing games at home<br/></b>As time passed, computers became smaller. From the late 1970s, home computers and game consoles made digital games accessible to anyone who was willing to shell out the cash. From today's standpoint, both the graphics and the scope of the games were severely limited. This had less to do with a lack of imagination on the part of developers and more to do with the computing power of the machines.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>From pixels to virtual reality<br/><b>Pushing limits<br/></b>The science fiction game Elite from 1984 pushed computers to their limits. Sitting in a spaceship cockpit, players can explore space in real time and discover its galaxies and more than 1,000 planets. Elite opened up new worlds to players, and is regarded as one of the pioneers of the open world games, which are so popular today.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>From pixels to virtual reality<br/><b>Save? OK!<br/></b>Another annoying problem was that early 8-bit consoles, such as the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), had no memory function. So to see the end of a game, players had to keep going. When the console was turned off, the score disappeared. This changed with the new generation of consoles, and allowed developers to create even larger game worlds.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>From pixels to virtual reality<br/><b>From 2D to 3D<br/></b>First-person shooter games came about with Doom (1993) and Quake (1996). Though this new genre polarized people due to its brutality (both of the games were on Germany's blacklist until 2011), the programming skills of the developers were phenomenal. For the first time, they created 3D worlds through which players could move freely. At the time, it was a revolution.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>From pixels to virtual reality<br/><b>Photo-realism and music<br/></b>The introduction of the CD-ROM boosted the development of digital games even further. Diskettes had a storage capacity of 1.4 MB, console modules only slightly more. A CD, on the other hand, had 700 MB, and paved the way for film-like scene switching and editing, photorealistic graphics and high-quality sound. Some people even used their PlayStations as CD players due to their excellent sound.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>From pixels to virtual reality<br/><b>Top-quality graphics<br/></b>Despite the retro trend, many games of the early 3D era are unplayable today. The graphics in particular have not stood the test of time well. As graphics cards have become more and more powerful, players have become spoiled. What once looked unbeatably good, now seems outdated. The shooter game Halo from 2001, for example, was considered the ultimate in graphics at the time.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>From pixels to virtual reality<br/><b>Get off the couch!<br/></b>The Japanese company Nintendo forged new ground with the Wii console in 2006. The controllers reacted to the movements of the players, causing some to break out into a sweat. Even older people starting playing on the consoles, suddenly being able to bowl or play tennis again. Fitness and dance games boomed. Other manufacturers also began developing motion controls.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>From pixels to virtual reality<br/><b>Time to feed the sheep...<br/></b>As the internet developed, so too did browser games, which also ended up on smartphones. Easy, casual games conquered the games market and still generate high revenues today, although such games are often ridiculed by "real" gamers due to their lack of complexity and their rather basic graphics.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>From pixels to virtual reality<br/><b>Playing on the go<br/></b>Collecting things and fighting — that's what Pokemon has been all about since 1996, when it first came out on the Gameboy. With the release of Pokemon Go in 2016, the cute pocket monsters leapt from the digital world and into reality thanks to augmented reality (AR) technology. It allows players to search for digital monsters in the real world and let them compete against each other in.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>From pixels to virtual reality<br/><b>Complete immersion<br/></b>Virtual reality (VR) technology enables players to even more fully immerse themselves into the action. So far, however, it has not been able to compete on the mass market, although it offers plenty of innovative game concepts. It also has one big disadvantage: Some players get sick to their stomachs after just a short time in a virtual reality.<br/>Author: Kristina Reymann-Schneider (als)</figcaption>

      <p>The big tech companies want their share of the cloud gaming market, with Google sending Stadia into the race, Microsoft the Xcloud project, Electronic Arts the Atlas project, Nvidia the service GeForce Now, and Sony its Playstation Now. Cloud gaming enables players to stream digital games via the internet on any device with a screen, making it a kind of Netflix for games. Some consider the service a way of democratizing gaming, while others are skeptical because they say games are an interactive medium and time delays caused by a poor internet connection can lead to "death on the screen."</p>
      <p>Although the next generation of consoles could be released next year, the new Playstation will be aimed at hardcore gamers, manufacturer Sony said. In other words, it's for players who want to immediately experience the latest game with optimal quality in graphics. <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/gamescom-cloud-gaming-turns-industry-inside-out/a-50112957">Cloud gaming</a>, on the other hand, targets the mass market, aiming to appeal to casual gamers, said Juancho Carrillo of the Spanish cloud gaming provider Play Giga. These people might not consider themselves to be players, but may occasionally fiddle around on their smartphone for a few minutes a day, moving pieces of candy around, building a fortress or solving puzzles.</p>

        <b>Casual players vs. hardcore gamers</b>
      </p>
      <p>Real gamers smirk when it comes to these sorts of "casual games," yet they are commercially very successful since they reach a large audience rather than just a select group. What they have in common is their basic level of difficulty. They're easily accessible and do not require any special skills on the part of the players, and they're generally free. The game companies earn their money from in-game purchases: a bag of gold coins to advance faster, or a fancy uniform to give your character an individual touch. In addition, the levels are relatively short, with the next goal reached in just a few minutes.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>This distinguishes them from games such as Tomb Raider, Grand Theft Auto and the Assassin's Creed series. Such games require players to invest much more time and use a variety of keys on either a controller or with a mouse and keyboard. Not everyone can do that well. "In contrast to films, the reception of games is simply much more complex," said Jochen Koubek, media scientist at the University of Bayreuth, the only German university that offers a course in computer games. "In order to play a game, you have to be willing to do much more, and also be committed to it."</p>
      <p>"The fact that one is even able to play such a game is not as widespread as one might assume, since smartphone games are not devised in the same way console or PC games are in terms of the keys or the hand-eye coordination required."</p>

        <b>A devaluation?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Spotify has altered pop music, while Netflix has further fueled the mania for series. What impact will online game libraries have on digital games themselves? "Some fear that cloud gaming will, like Spotify or iTunes, lead to the devaluation of computer games as a medium," said Jochen Koubek. When hundreds of games are offered on cloud gaming platforms, they compete with each other. "Once a player's frustration grows, he won't say 'Ok, I've invested 30, 50 or 60 euros, so I'll stick to it.' Instead, he'll just move on to the next game. That leads to games being made differently."</p>
      <p>This development is evident in smartphone games. "These games are oriented towards the mass market and take into account what works for the majority of people," he said. That's facilitated by the data that companies access from online gamers. With it, they see what users like, where they stop, which psychological tricks work well, and what players are actually willing to pay money for.</p>

        <figcaption>Discovering new worlds, tapping into resources, upgrading spaceships, and players fly off again: "No Man's Sky" is a classic game of exploration</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        <b>New technologies, new genres</b>
      </p>
      <p>Over the course of time, new technologies have led to the creation of new genres. With regard to cloud gaming, it will only be possible to see what those developments are in retrospect, although some tendencies are already emerging. Examples include games meant for the masses, casual games, games for the whole family, games that are not too difficult and are not entirely disrupted when there are second-long delays. These include puzzles and construction games, for example, or exploration games like No Man's Sky, in which players travel from planet to planet, discover plants and animals, tap into resources, upgrade their spaceships, and fly on, with the cycle starting all over again.</p>

        <figcaption>A family-friendly game two players can play sitting next to each other on the couch: co-op games like "Lego Jurassic World"</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Quiet role-playing games which focus on the development of characters are another option. Couch co-op games, in which players sit next to each other and compete, could also make a comeback. At PlayGiga, this type of game is in high demand.</p>
      <p>
        <b>A change in image</b>
      </p>
      <p>More than 2.5 billion people worldwide play digital games, but if cloud gaming gains more ground, that number will continue to rise. It will also impact how gamers and players are perceived. The cliché of the pimply teenager sitting at his desk in a darkened room between mountains of pizza boxes and bottles of energy drinks while targeting terrorists remains steadfast. But if everyone starts playing, that will change. "People will realize that they're just modes of entertainment," said Koubek. "You don't have to be a certain type of person to like something like that. Suddenly, you will turn into 'those other people,' and then the others suddenly become you," says Koubek. That, too, is nothing new in the history of media.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Playing together: fun for the whole family?</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>"Each distribution channel that includes games contributes to making them more mainstream," added media scientist Philipp Bojahr of the Cologne Game Lab at the city's TH technical university. "This has happened again and again with every medium in the past. In the beginning, people are always skeptical, then some niche group accepts it, then it enjoys broad popularity. The book was once demonized, film was rejected, but nowadays, people everywhere cherish these types of media. Apparently. it will only be a matter of time before people won't view others as odd for having stayed up all night playing games. After all, watching a series all night is hardly unusual – that's something no one could have imagined 20 years ago. </p>

            <figcaption><b>Trüberbrook (2019)<br/></b>The game Trüberbrook, produced by the small btf studio in Cologne, is set in rural Germany in the 1960s. Tannhauser, a student from the US, lands in a village called Trüberbrook, where he experiences a series of mysterious events. The game doesn't skimp on references to German cultural history, including Goethe's Gretchen.</figcaption>

            <figcaption><b>Through the Darkest of Times (2019)<br/></b>Berlin, 1933. Resistance fighters are plotting against the Nazis. Despite its simple visual style, the strategy game Through the Darkest of Times is an engaging one, as a player's decisions truly influence the story. The group of partisans is fictitious, but everything else in the game is inspired by actual events during the Third Reich.</figcaption>

            <figcaption><b>All Walls Must Fall (2018)<br/></b>The secret agent thriller All Walls Must Fall takes place in an alternate future version of Berlin. The year is 2089, but the Cold War never ended. The player is a spy trying to prevent a nuclear attack while flirting his way through the booming techno beats of Berlin's club scene. Despite the compelling setting, the game wasn't a hit. Consequently, the small studio inbetweengames had to close.</figcaption>

            <figcaption><b>Call of Duty: WWII (2017)<br/></b>War games are a genre of their own; World War I and II are particularly popular among game developers. In Call of Duty: WWII, a player can for instance wander through the city of Aachen and fight the Nazis. The Holocaust is usually not part of the narrative of shooter games like this. The point is rather to offer quick action, with clear identification of friend and foe.</figcaption>
