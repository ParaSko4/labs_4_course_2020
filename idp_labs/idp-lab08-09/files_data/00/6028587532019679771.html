      <p>I worried that I might get smug as I began my transition to playing games primarily on PC, and it is, indeed, a constant battle. We’re on the verge of a new console generation now, but I’m already steaming ahead into the future with a souped-up gaming rig that’s as or more powerful than anything Sony of Microsoft is likely to put into their next-gen consoles, and I’m loving it. I’ve talked before about ray-tracing, one lighting-oriented feature that seems poised to define graphics tech in 2020 and beyond, but that’s not what’s going to be most striking feature of the Xbox Scarlett or PS5. I’ve also got an SSD, and it wasn’t until playing <i>Jedi: Fallen Order</i> this weekend that it really struck me how much this is going to change the console world. I don’t have a standard SSD in my PC, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2899351/everything-you-need-to-know-about-nvme.html">I’ve got the improved NVMe SSD, </a>the particularities of which are far beyond my area of expertise but the practicalities of which are abundantly obvious: it is super, super fast. And it makes gaming into a very different experience.</p>
      <p>I still have loading screens in my games–not only are we likely to still have some loading screens in next-gen, modern games just aren’t built assuming that everyone will have incredibly fast SSDs, something that’s likely to change as we move into the next-gen. But the loading screens that I have are so short as to be virtually unnoticeable, and it makes for a strikingly unbroken gaming experience. There are certain games for me that were virtually defined by loading screens: the cracks in the game world between interior and exterior in <i>Skyrim</i>, for example, or the punishing wait that followed failure in <i>Bloodborne</i>. I, like most others I’d assume, would always check my phone as I waited for the game to kick back up again. Now, the game just doesn’t really stop.</p>
      <p>It’s hard to know exactly what this will look like with Xbox Scarlett and PS5, because we don’t have complete specs on them yet. But consoles gain a lot of efficiencies from their locked-in hardware sets and a developer’s ability to code for predictable hardware, and so I have to imagine that the new experience is going to be at least as good as what I’m seeing with my NVMe SSD now. And when it comes, it’s going to be even more striking than ray-tracing.</p>
      <p>The most interesting thing about this, to me, is that this experience isn’t entirely new, it’s just that we haven’t had it in a very long time. I still remember when I first started encountering loading screens in console games with the PS2, the first disc-based system I owned. Before that I had an N64, which utilized physical cartridges for a virtually loading screen-free experience. The thing still had to boot up, of course, but after that it was every bit as fast and clean as my modern NVMe SSD. What’s old is new again.</p>
