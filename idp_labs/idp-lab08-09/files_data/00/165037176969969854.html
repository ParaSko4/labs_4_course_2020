        <b>Belgium coach, Roberto Martinez, thinks that the difficult start to the season that Eden Hazard has had with Real Madrid is down a few factors, such as injury and having to learn to understand his new teammates and viceversa.</b>
      </p>
      <p>"It's true that in his club, due to injury, he has had a slow start.<b> You are going to a different championship with a different way of playing.</b> It probably takes time for the other plays to understand what his quality is on the field. This is an adaptation period," Martinez declared in a press conference.</p>
      <p><b>Belgium play Cyprus tomorrow</b> in Brussels, as part of their qualification for the Euro 2020, something which Beligum have already been garantueed mathematically.</p>
      <p>The Spanish coach did not say if Hazard has already reached his best football level this season,<b> but said he is on the right track.</b></p>
      <p>"That's difficult to answer for me because<b> he has always been on the same level. </b>If you look at his influence, his statistics, his number of assists,<b> his goals in the last 35 games with the national team</b>, he has been very consistent," he said.</p>
      <p>Martinez added that he had followed some of Real Madrid's last games where the captain has played and believes that he is on the right track.</p>

      <p><b>"I have seen Eden play against Eibar and he returned to play as he usually does.</b> It is not only<a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/e-hazard-21292"> Eden's</a> responsibility to do the best he can. This comes with time. I think that Eden is improving day by day and <b>he is close to returning to his best,"</b> he stated.</p>
      <p>Before Tuesday's game against Cyprus, Roberto Martinez stated that <b>there will be changes from his usual scheme </b>because he wants to gain "information" about some players, as there <b>won't be another international break for the national teams until next March</b>, and called the fans to enjoy the classification.</p>
      <p>"Tomorrow has to be a party (...). <b>This team is exceptional and we have to enjoy it with the fans,</b>" said Martinez, who recalled that Belgium came third in the 2018 World Cup in Russia and now wants to "do better in the next competition".</p>
      <p>Belgium who have qualified for the UEFA EURO since the last round of matches, with<b> 34 goals scored and two conceded in nine matches</b>, will be looking to give their home fans in Brussels a victory over Cyprus that closes an immaculate qualifying phase with ten wins in ten matches.</p>
      <p>The Belgian FA, the URBSFA, wants to turn Tuesday's (18.45 GMT) match against Cyprus into <b>a big party in front of their home crowd</b> at the King Baudouin Stadium in Brussels.</p>
      <p>The organisers will distribute <b>34,000 flags with the effigies of internationals Thomas Meunier and Michy Batshuayi </b>and accompany the match with a concert by the Italian-American artist Gala, whose song "Freed from Desire" sounds every time Belgium scores a goal, among other animations.</p>
