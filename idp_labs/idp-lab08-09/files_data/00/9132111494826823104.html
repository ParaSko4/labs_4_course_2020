      <p>A 60-year-old woman with clubfoot, who has been farming for 15 years, is appealing to the public to assist her to establish a new business as she prepares to retire.</p>
      <p>Madam Abdulai Hawa, mostly referred to as Iron Lady, owns 4 acres of maize, 2 acres of groundnut, 3 acres of cassava, 2 acres of beans and an acre of okro farm at Salaga in the Savannah Region.</p>
      <p>She rides 3 kilometres to her farm on a manual tricycle, a routine she explained, is taking a toll on her health because of old age. The tricycle is in bad condition and requires a lot of manpower ride it.</p>
      <p>“The work is stressful. I have to take medicine everyday to be able to sleep after the day’s work,” Iron Lady told 3news.com.</p>
      <p>She said age is catching up to her, the reason she wants to quit her farming job for a new business that will not require a lot of physical activity.</p>
      <p>Though she said she makes money from her farming, “my worry is, I’m 60 years and going old day by day”.</p>
      <p>Although Iron Lady said she hires people to spray her farm for her, she does the weeding all by herself.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Who’s she?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Madam Hawa was born with clubfoot, a common foot abnormality, in which the foot points downward and inward. She has since childhood been living with the condition and stigmatisation.</p>
      <p>As a believer of ‘disability is not inability’, she did not allow her disability to pin her down, but did all things possible to fend for herself and family.</p>
      <p>At an early age, she crawled half a kilometre to school daily, and mostly came back home with sores from her crawling but that did not discourage her from pursuing her dream.</p>
      <p>In 1973, Iron Lady completed Form 4 at the Salaga Middle Day School after enduring years of stigmatisation mostly from her colleagues at school, she recounted.</p>
      <p>After Form 4, Madam Hawa said she enrolled as an apprentice to learn dress making, but she had to leave due to poor eyesight.</p>
      <p>Eventually, she ended up as a petty trader, selling locally made liquid soap.</p>
      <p>Though not married, Madam Hawa had three children but lost one of them four years ago.</p>
      <p>Her son, Mahama Yussif , who is a mason, says he is worried about the work her mother does and would have loved to set her up but he does not have the financial muscle.</p>
      <p>He is, however, hopeful there will be better days for her mother.</p>
      <p>Iron Lady’s daughter is pregnant and lives with the man who impregnated her.</p>
