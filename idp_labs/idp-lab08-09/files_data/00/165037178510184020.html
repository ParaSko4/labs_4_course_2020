        <b>Belgium's mentality has improved since the World Cup and they should be considered among the favourites for Euro 2020, says Eden Hazard.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/e-hazard-21292">Eden Hazard</a> believes <b>Belgium will head to Euro 2020 stronger than ever </b>and must improve on their third-place finish at the 2018 World Cup.</p>
      <p><b>Roberto Martinez</b>'s side have<b> a 100 per cent record after nine games</b> in qualifying for the European Championship and will seek to finish their campaign with<b> a maximum 30 points against Cyprus</b> on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils <b>finished third in last year's World Cup </b>and lead the FIFA rankings, and Hazard thinks they are<b> better equipped for their next major tournament.</b></p>
      <p>"We have two years more experience than at the World Cup, <b>two more years with the coach,</b>" said Real Madrid star Hazard.</p>
      <p>"We know each other better, <b>we have young players </b>… I think we are stronger. We have<b> developed the winning mentality</b> that we didn't have enough at Euro 2016 and the World Cup".</p>
