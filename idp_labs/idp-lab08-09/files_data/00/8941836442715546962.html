      <h1>Chick-fil-A ends donations to Salvation Army after years of LGBTQ back</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/jessica-chasmar/" target="_blank">Jessica Chasmar</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chick-fil-a/">Chick-fil-A</a> will stop future donations to The Salvation Army and the Fellowship of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/christian-athletes/">Christian Athletes</a> following years of backlash from the LGBTQ community.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chick-fil-a/">Chick-fil-A</a> announced Monday that it would refocus its charitable efforts on a smaller number of organizations that work exclusively in the areas of education, homelessness and hunger. It confirmed that The Salvation Army and the Fellowship of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/christian-athletes/">Christian Athletes</a> would no longer be part of that effort, Business Insider <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chick-fil-a-ending-donations-criticized-by-lgbtq-activists-2019-11">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>“We made multiyear commitments to both organizations, and we fulfilled those obligations in 2018,” a company spokesperson said. “Moving forward you will see that the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chick-fil-a/">Chick-fil-A</a> Foundation will support the three specific initiatives of homelessness, hunger and education.”</p>
      <p>“Additionally, the Foundation will no longer make multiyear commitments and will reassess its philanthropic partnerships annually to allow maximum impact,” the company said in a <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chick-fil-a-foundation-announces-2020-priorities-to-address-education-homelessness-hunger-1028697144">press release</a>. “These partners could include faith-based and non-faith-based charities.”</p>
      <p>The news follows years of boycotting from the LGBTQ community, which was renewed this spring after the left-wing outlet ThinkProgress released a report saying <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chick-fil-a/">Chick-fil-A</a>’s foundation donated $1.8 million in 2017 to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/christian-athletes/">Christian</a> and socially conservative groups with an alleged history of anti-LGBTQ bias.</p>

      <p>The renewed criticism stemmed from 2012 when CEO Dan Cathy, a conservative <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/christian-athletes/">Christian</a>, revealed his disapproval of gay marriage.</p>
