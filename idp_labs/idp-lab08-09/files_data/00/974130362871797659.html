      <h1>Late Venue Changes No Problem For Senior And Intermediate Ladies Finalists</h1>

      <p>Over the weekend, the All-Ireland ladies club football finals double-header, which was scheduled to be played at Parnell Park in Dublin on Saturday, became no more.</p>
      <p>Instead, the venues were switched with the senior final heading down the M7 to Limerick and the intermediate decider on the M3 to Cavan.</p>
      <p>Despite the lateness of the changes, none of the four teams involved are especially troubled.</p>
      <p>"For a couple of hours there, we didn't know where the match was going to be played, but it was literally only a couple of hours," said Kevin Reidy, manager of Kilkerrin/Cloberne, who play in the senior final against reigning champions Mourneabbey.</p>
      <p>"I think a lot more support from Kilkerrin and Clonberne will travel as well, because it's only like an hour and 20 or 30 minutes from where we are," added club captain Louise Ward.</p>
      <p>The only factor bothering Mourneabbey's Eimear Meaney is that the opposition forwards may have a bit more room in which to operate in Limerick than they would have had in Dublin.</p>
      <p>"The pitch is probably a bit wider," said Meaney, "Parnell Park is more of a narrow pitch so, maybe as a back, I'm giving out about that! The forwards will be delighted with the space."</p>
      <p>Mourneabbey selector Derry Cronin added:</p>
      <p>"We were preparing for a week to go to Dublin and suddenly, last Saturday, we had to rejig and reset the sat nav for Limerick.</p>
      <p>"There were a few headaches, people with trains and what not booked but, look, that only added to the attention that the game has got locally. People would be very much into it, all the girls' friends, families and neighbours buy into it."</p>
      <p>Kilkerrin/Clonberne of Galway face Cork's Mourneabbey in the All-Ireland Ladies Senior Club Football Championship final at the Gaelic Grounds in Limerick at 5pm on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the day, Belfast side Naomh Pól play Naomh Ciarán of Offaly at 2:30pm in the intermediate decider.</p>
      <p>On Sunday at 2pm, Cork team Donoghmoure play Mayo's CL MacHale Rovers at Duggan Park in Ballinasloe in the junior final.</p>
