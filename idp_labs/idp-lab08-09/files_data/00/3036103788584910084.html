      <h1>Building Africa’s first interconnected carrier neutral data centres</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/partner" target="_blank">Partner</a></address>
      <p>When Liquid Telecom first approached Stephane Duproz to lead its data centre business, he could immediately see that the company was sitting on a winner. However, it would require significant organisational changes to realise its full potential.</p>
      <p>“We realised that there was more potential than originally thought and I presented a big development plan,” Duproz told MyBroadband during a recent interview at AfricaCom.</p>
      <p>His plan started with separating the entire data centre business from Liquid.</p>
      <p>There are many data centre operators in Africa, and there are even companies that operate data centres in several countries on the continent, but they are all telecommunications providers.</p>
      <p>Until Africa Data Centres, there was no pan-African carrier neutral data centre provider on the continent.</p>
      <p>In essence, carrier neutrality means that a data centre does not favour one telecommunications provider over others.</p>
      <p>“Without carrier neutrality, there is no story,” said Duproz.</p>
      <p>“Everywhere in the world, the big success, the value created by data centres is when they are carrier neutral.”</p>
      <p>His pitch was successful. Africa Data Centres was formed as a sister company to Liquid Telecom, rather than a subsidiary. Duproz serves as the Chief Executive Officer for Africa Data Centres.</p>
      <h3>Sitting on a goldmine</h3>
      <p>Liquid’s play to become a data centre powerhouse in Africa began with a series of acquisitions.</p>
      <p>“It started with the acquisition of companies like Kenya Data Networks in Kenya, and Neotel in South Africa,” Duproz said.</p>
      <p>“That came with customers and customer contracts, and obligations linked to those contracts.”</p>
      <p>At that point Liquid decided to significantly strengthen the team dealing with data centres and the company recruited someone to deal with it.</p>
      <p>“That was me a little more than a year ago,” said Duproz.</p>
      <p>Duproz then recruited seasoned data centre professionals from Europe and the United States to bring in the global expertise needed to grow the business.</p>
      <p>Among them is Katie Hill, who worked at Apple for nearly five years, procuring energy for its data centres and heading up its Clean Energy Programme.</p>
      <p>Xavier Matagne joined Africa Data Networks from global data centre giant Equinix, where he worked for more than eight years. Matagne led various development projects across the EMEA region.</p>
      <p>Duproz himself was Group Director for Europe at Global Switch, and before that was MD of the French subsidiary of TelecityGroup.</p>
      <p>“There are plenty of skills here, but we have 20 years of experience Africa doesn’t have yet,” Duproz said.</p>

      <h3>Growth</h3>
      <p>When US-based industry giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google have data centre needs in North America or Europe, they know who to ask.</p>
      <p>“In Africa, they don’t [know who to go to],” Duproz said.</p>
      <p>This is something that has delayed the take-up in African data centres by big hyperscalers like Amazon Web Services.</p>
      <p>“We are bringing the experience to work with local skills, to create a world class organisation so that the Americans feel comfortable,” said Duproz.</p>
      <p>By presenting a global pedigree to the American cloud giants, they know they have found a partner they can trust.</p>
      <p>Since launching just over a year ago, Africa Data Centres has tripled its capacity and its footprint across Africa.</p>
      <p>They started with facilities in Cape Town, Johannesburg, and Nairobi, and have expanded to Mombasa, Lagos, Harare, Kigali, Abidjan, Dakar, and Casablanca.</p>
      <h3>Carrier neutral</h3>
      <p>Each of these sites are interconnected. Duproz said that a benefit of being founded out of Liquid Telecom is that they don’t have to wonder or worry where the initial connectivity for a site will come from.</p>
      <p>However, he made it crystal clear to Liquid that they will not receive any preferential treatment from Africa Data Centres.</p>
      <p>From a corporate perspective, the company is held in London through Africa Data Centres Holdings Limited. They also recently incorporated a (Pty.) Ltd. company in South Africa, with two Liquid Telecoms executives as directors: Reshaad Sha, and Malvin Meyer.</p>
      <p>Although Africa Data Centres is a sister company to Liquid Telecom, Duproz said that clients will never be pressured to choose Liquid for connectivity.</p>
      <p>In fact, to ensure there is a diversity of connectivity options available at their data centres, Duproz said that he is incentivising other carriers to come and compete with Liquid in their facilities.</p>
      <p>Duproz also told MyBroadband that they have no intention to own the Internet exchange points in their data centres. For that reason they have partnered with exchanges like INX-ZA and the Kenya Internet Exchange Point.</p>
      <p>“The Internet, which is the base of the digital ecosystem, likes freedom. It like open access,” said Duproz.</p>
      <p>“What we are doing, is helping local communities develop their own independent Internet exchange points.”</p>
