      <p>The United States President, <a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/01/us-congress-approves-donald-trumps-impeachment-process/"><u><b>Donald Trump</b></u></a> has been invited to testify in front of investigators in the House impeachment inquiry ahead of a week that will see several key witnesses appear publicly.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> understands the invitation was presented to Trump as he was seen at Walter Reed National Medical Center on Saturday for what the White House said were medical tests as part of his annual physical checks.</p>
      <p>Press Secretary, <b>Stephanie Grisham</b>, said Trump, 73, was “anticipating a very busy 2020” and took advantage of a free time Washington to fulfill his annual routine checkup.</p>
      <p>She did not specify which tests her boss had received but disclosed that the president had “a quick exam and labs”.</p>
      <p>However, speaking on the invitation to testify, Democratic House Speaker <a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/09/10/us-house-ready-to-step-up-trump-impeachment-probe/"><u><b>Nancy Pelosi</b> </u></a>has asked president, Donald Trump to come and prove his innocence.</p>
      <p>If he has information that is exculpatory, that means ex, taking away, culpable, blame, then we look forward to seeing it,<i>” she said in an interview that aired Sunday on CBS’s Face the Nation. “Trump could come right before the committee and talk, speak all the truth that he wants if he wants,”</i> she said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, reacting to the invitation, Donald Trump has said the witnesses have no idea of what they want to testify about. He tweeted:</p>
