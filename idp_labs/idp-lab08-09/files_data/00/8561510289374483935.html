      <p><a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/researchers-depression-may-be-a-physical-illness-linked-to-inflammation">Inflammation</a> has become one of the biggest buzzwords in health and wellness circles in recent years. And while all the fuss over inflammation it may seem like yet another fad promulgated by television quacks and bloggers, it’s really not. Many health professionals now believe that understanding and controlling chronic inflammation is the future of preventative medicine. That’s why <a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/cbd-for-inflammation">Mellowment CBD</a> has specifically developed a specific type of CBD for inflammation. It’s called <a href="https://mellowment.com/products/for-inflammation/?rfsn=2372257.23d448&amp;subid=prod-2601">Mellowment High Impact for Inflammation</a>, and it combines CBD and curcumin for maximum inflammation relief, recovery, and comfort.</p>

      <p>Inflammation is an essential survival mechanism of the human immune system. As such, it’s <i>usually</i> a good thing, a sign that the body is working to heal an injury or fight off some pathogen or disease. When <a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/why-you-should-pay-attention-to-chronic-inflammation/">cells are in distress</a>, they release chemicals that alerts the immune system. The immune system in turn sends inflammatory cells to capture the pathogens or heal damaged tissues. Meanwhile, blood vessels in the area expand to accommodate the additional immune system traffic and bring fluid to the site of the injury or infection. This is called acute inflammation. And while it is painful and uncomfortable, it’s also necessary.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, sometimes this natural immune system response does not get switched off. Sometimes it’s because the cause of the initial immune system response cannot be eliminated. Sometimes the immune system simply malfunctions. Either way, the immune system tells white blood cells to attack healthy tissues and organs, resulting in chronic inflammation.</p>
      <p>While all adults experience some level of chronic inflammation that slowly wears down our organs and tissues, in some people this chronic inflammation is more extreme. And what scientists have finally realized is that this excessive chronic inflammation causes major damage that contributes to many of the <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/Inflammation_A_unifying_theory_of_disease">most common degenerative diseases</a>, including coronary artery disease, diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimer’s.</p>
      <p>The good news? Numerous studies suggest that treating chronic inflammation can significantly reduce the risk for these diseases.</p>

      <p>Mellowment has become one of the leading names in CBD over the last few years thanks to their exacting scientific methods and rigorous quality control. With <a href="https://mellowment.com/products/for-inflammation/?rfsn=2372257.23d448&amp;subid=prod-2601">High Impact for Inflammation</a>, they’ve combined their proprietary CBD formula with and curcumin, a compound found in the spice turmeric that has been used as an herbal medicine in India for thousands of years.</p>
      <p>CBD has long been observed to have anti-inflammatory effects. Now we’re finally starting to understand why. According to one study, for example, CBD reduces inflammation by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2828614/">modulating the endocannabinoid system</a> and disrupting the production of cytokines, which are proteins secreted by immune cells that trigger inflammation. As for curcumin, modern science has proven it has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, and <a href="https://www.arthritis.org/living-with-arthritis/treatments/natural/supplements-herbs/guide/turmeric.php">numerous studies</a> have shown it to be effective in treating inflammation and pain associated with arthritis.</p>

      <p>One of the problems in treating inflammation with CBD and curcumin is that both compounds typically have poor bioavailability. That means they are not easily absorbed into your system due to poor absorption, rapid metabolism, and rapid elimination. However, Mellowment has solved the bioavailability problem. By subjecting CBD and curcumin to an advanced nano-emulsification process that shrinks and suspends the active ingredients microscopic droplets of oil which can easily pass through cell walls, Mellowment more than doubles their bioavailability. That means more CBD and curcumin reach systemic circulation, ensuring maximum effectiveness.</p>
      <p>Each bottle of <a href="https://mellowment.com/products/for-inflammation/?rfsn=2372257.23d448&amp;subid=prod-2601">Mellowment High-Impact for Inflammation</a> contains 30 softgels, with each softgel containing a 25mg dose of CBD and a 10mg dose of curcumin. They’re formulated to be taken as needed, and most customers take one to four softgels per day. Mellowment’s CBD extracts are meticulously engineered from Colorado-grown hemp using an advanced chromatography process that removes all THC, eliminating the risk of failed drug tests and undesired psychoactive effects.</p>
      <p>Whether you’re looking for natural relief from discomfort caused by acute inflammation, or you want to combat chronic inflammation and reduce your risk for more serious degenerative conditions, <a href="https://mellowment.com/products/for-inflammation/?rfsn=2372257.23d448&amp;subid=prod-2601">Mellowment High Impact for Inflammation could be right for you  </a></p>
