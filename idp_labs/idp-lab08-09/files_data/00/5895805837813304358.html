        <b>1. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/resilience">Resilience</a> is Our Default Mode.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Trouble often gets top billing in our media and our minds. The front page of the paper and the TV news shows are filed with stories of brokenness—social, political, moral, personal. Our conscious <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/attention">attention</a>, too (our mind's 'front page'), is drawn inevitably to threat, mayhem, trouble and disorder. We stop to look at a gruesome accident scene not because we enjoy the sight, but because we’re compelled by the evolved architecture of our brain to study it. Attention to threat, to violence, to irregularity, to trouble improves our survival odds. Yet it is important to remember that the basic processes of our species—for example, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/pregnancy">pregnancy</a>, language acquisition, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/child-development">child development</a>, social <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/attachment">bonding</a>, etc.—are ‘well buffered’ processes. The ‘buffers’ in question are psychosocial and biological resources that reduce the impact of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/stress">stress</a> and other threats on development and health (for <a href="https://sk.sagepub.com/reference/socialpsychology/n76.xml">example</a>, social support is a strong buffer against the adverse effects of negative life events). This is why most pregnancies result in a healthy child, most people succeed in learning language, most survivors of childhood adversity recover, and most people who've lost one spouse or partner find another.</p>

      <p>Well-buffered processes are designed by evolution to go right, and are not easily subverted or derailed. This makes intuitive sense if you think about it. If our default had been weakness, trouble, failure or deformity, then our species would have devolved into extinction.</p>
      <p>The fact that resilience is our default mode is obscured because normalcy does not make the news. To wit: Airplane crashes make the news. Yet safe air travel is the overwhelming norm. Remembering this may help one remain calm amidst the onslaught of scary news and headlines.</p>
      <p>2.<b> The Meaning of Social Facts Changes with Social Context</b></p>
      <p>Years ago I went to a friend’s wedding that was held at a ‘clothing optional’ resort (in California, naturally). Throughout the day, family members and guests lounged around the woods and hot springs, naked. This felt quite odd to me at first. Soon enough, however, a simple truth dawned: public nudity is not <i>inherently</i> odd. It is only odd when it takes place amidst otherwise clothed people. In other words, the meaning of nudity is a feature of social process, not an inherent feature of the content of nudity itself. When everyone around you is naked, you’ll feel quite odd walking around fully clothed.<br/>Context determines meaning. Social context is dynamic, and thus the meaning of social facts changes as social context does. Consider <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/divorce">divorce</a> as a case in point. Research has shown that parental divorce generally predicts poorer outcomes for children. But those effects are neither pre-determined nor uniform. First, as mentioned above, child development is a well buffered process, designed for success. Thus, most children whose parents divorce are resilient and exhibit <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6313686/">no obvious psychological problems</a>.</p>
      <p>In addition, the impact of divorce is powerfully shaped by social context. For example, in cultures where divorce is rare, its <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352827316301835">effects</a> on children are more severe. Recent <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/15/7266">research</a> has found that children of divorce who come from families considered highly likely to divorce don’t suffer the same adverse educational attainment consequences as children of divorce who come from unlikely-to-divorce couples. The post-divorce<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/721b/29eede12f32c63641d3ad6f67bb21373a017.pdf"> parental adjustment</a> also affects child adaptation. Parents who are financially stable, who manage their emotions and co-<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/parenting">parenting</a> relations effectively, and who allow the children to remain in <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/environment">the environment</a> to which they have grown attached, have children who are much less affected by the divorce.</p>
      <p>All this makes intuitive sense. Aspects of the social environment help shape the meaning of social facts. If you’re the only child of divorce in your classroom or friends group or neighborhood, then you will take severe consequences. Yet this is not an inherent consequence of divorce. Rather, the consequences emerge from the context within which you are immersed. If everyone in your class is children of divorce, and everyone around the country is, too, then you no longer will suffer as much.</p>
      <p>This means that a changing social context can render a problem solved. Some difficulties are inherent in the human condition, and we cannot escape them or control whether they will occur or not; but their <i>meaning</i> is malleable, resting heavily on our social environment and conduct--both of which are, to some degree, under our control.</p>
      <p>3.<b> Subjective and Objective Difficulties are Not One and The Same</b></p>
      <p>Many of us confuse the important distinction between objectively and subjectively difficult tasks. The former is difficult for most everyone, due to structural task (and species) variables. The latter is difficult for some, for a variety of reasons, many of which are not inherent to the task, such as newness. When a task is difficult because it’s new, (i.e. subjectively difficult) then the issue at hand is practice and effort. With some amount of those, the difficulty will disappear. remembering your social security number, for example, was at first difficult for you. Over time, it ceased to be so. When a task is objectively difficult, it is hard every time, and for almost everyone, due to its structural <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/identity">identity</a> or essence. Try to swallow your saliva thirty times in ten seconds. That’s hard for everyone, everywhere, always. The distinction is important in everyday life. If you experience difficulty, it’s useful to ask yourself whether you are dealing with the objective or subjective kind, as their characteristic trajectories differ, and your expectations (and behavior) should be adjusted accordingly.</p>
      <p>
        <b>4. Problem and Solution Need Not Be of the Same 'Species.'</b>
      </p>
      <p>PKU is a rare genetic disease, an inborn error of metabolism resulting in decreased metabolism of the amino acid phenylalanine. Untreated, PKU can lead to <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/intellectual-disability-intellectual-developmental-disorder">intellectual disability</a>, seizures, behavioral problems, and mental disorders. The main way to treat PKU is by eating a special <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/diet">diet</a> that limits foods containing phenylalanine.</p>
      <p>This example illustrates an important yet often overlooked truth: Solutions to a problem in one domain may come from a different domain entirely.</p>
      <p>A client of mine was recently musing about the fact that while her <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anxiety">anxiety</a> proneness was largely biological, a part of her genetic endowment, and a feature of her evolved brain structure and processes, the solution I was offering was not biological but psychological: talk <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/therapy">therapy</a>. Ignoring for the purpose of illustration the fact that the distinction between biology and psychology, like the nature-nurture distinction, is artificial—those are aspects of one integrated, synchronized system; experience (such as talk) is, in fact, both enabled by and changes the brain—her query was neither uncommon nor unreasonable. We are often led to believe that problem and solution should, and will, emerge from the same realm, speak the same language, as it were, or use similar materials—the key that locks the safe is needed to open it. Iron deficiency is corrected by ingesting more iron, etc.</p>
      <p>Over-generalizing this principle, however, is a mistake. In fact, solutions often arrive via processes that are separate and different from those that produced the problem. A warm bath may help your headache, even though your headache is not caused by a lack of warm water immersion. We can glue a broken vase back together even though no glue was used in creating it, etc. Similarly, a genetic problem may be effectively addressed through non-genetic, non-biological interventions, and vice versa.</p>
      <p>The mismatch between problem and solution is often a source of unnecessary confusion. For example, many clients distrust the ability to talk to alter brain process, or remedy the effects of their genetic endowment. Likewise, many clients view taking <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/psychopharmacology">medication</a> (a biological, external agent) to address their <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/depression">depressed</a> mood (an internal, psychological state) as some sort of personal failure. Yet psychoactive meds and talk therapies are both forms of advanced technology. We augment our natural-born internal capacities, and overcome the various mind and body limitations and injuries with the aid of technology all the time. We put on glasses to help us see. You could walk to work, but you use a car. Your skin can handle rain, but you use an umbrella. You could talk face to face, but you use your phone. A surgeon inserts a steel plate into your leg to allow it to operate again. A mother sings and rocks a baby to sleep. These solutions, repairs, and augmentations are not commonly seen as moral failures, character weaknesses, or cop-outs. They are seen, rightfully, as gifts from the culture, as progress, as competent care and sound <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/decision-making">decision-making</a>. They don’t diminish you, and they don’t make you less human or less ‘you.’</p>
      <p>The same generally holds for biological (meds) and psychological (talk) mental health technologies. Of course, like all technologies, they come with drawbacks, risks, and limitations; they should be used properly. But a blanket <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/bias">prejudice</a> against using (and cross-using) either is unwarranted.</p>
