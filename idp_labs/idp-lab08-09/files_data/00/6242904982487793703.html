        <b>German born Ghana winger Christopher Antwi-Adjei says he feels at home after joining the Black Stars team for the AFCON 2021 qualifiers. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The 25-year old Paderborn attacker was handed his maiden senior national team call up by coach Kwesi Appiah for the games against South Africa and Sao Tome and Principe.</p>
      <p>Antwi-Adjei was impressed by the reception from his teammates and says he feels home in the West African nation.</p>
      <p>“The team has welcomed me well since I joined them in camp and I am quiet impressed,” he told Ghanafa.org.</p>
      <p>“There is great bonding and they make me feel at home,” he added.</p>
      <p>The pacy winger could not feature in the game against South Africa due to his late arrival from his base in Germany.</p>
      <p>However, Antwi-Adjei could make his international debut when the Black Stars face Sao Tome on Monday afternoon.</p>
      <p>“Getting the call up is one dream, and playing is the ultimate. It will be a dream come true for me to wear the Ghana shirt,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The game against South Africa was a good game and my mates did very well. Our focus now is to play very well again and get a good result in our next game. If I get the opportunity against São Tomé, I also will do my best to help the team achieve its goal."</p>
