      <p>The World Trade Organisation (WTO) on November 18 said the global goods trade is expected to remain below trend in the fourth quarter of the current year amid increasing protectionism and increase in customs duties. The forecast does not augur well for India as the country's exports contracted for a third month in a row in October by 1.11 per cent to $26.38 billion.</p>

      <p>It said the indices for international air freight, electronic components, and raw materials have all deteriorated further below trend.</p>
      <p>Electronic components trade was weakest of all, possibly reflecting recent tariff hikes affecting the sector, it added.</p>
      <p>In September, WTO economists downgraded their trade growth expectations for 2019 to 1.2 per cent, down from the 2.6 per cent forecast in April.</p>
      <p>They attributed this substantial deceleration to slowing economic growth, increased tariffs, Brexit-related uncertainty, and the shifting monetary policy stance in developed economies.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
