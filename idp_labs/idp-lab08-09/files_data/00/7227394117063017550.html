      <h1>Samsung to offload a fifth of its production to Chinese ODM</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/author.php3?idAuthor=16" target="_blank">Ivan</a></address>
      <p>Samsung will aim to offload a fifth of its smartphone production to Chinese ODM Wingtech next year.</p>
      <p>According to a report by <i>Reuters</i> Samsung plans to manufacture some 300 million devices in 2020, out of which around 60 million will be manufactured in China by Wingtech.</p>
      <p>These will likely be Galaxy A devices. Furthermore Samsung plans to keep producing its flagship smartphones in Vietnam and India.</p>

      <p>Wingtech makes phones for Huawei, Xiaomi and Oppo, and <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_a10s_is_the_companys_second_odm_phone-news-38684.php">has made phones for Samsung in the past as well</a>.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year Samsung closed its <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_closes_its_last_smartphone_factory_in_china-news-39442.php">final factory in China</a>, in a move to scale back production costs. Chinese contractors are able to provide better prices for parts and manufacture phones at a lower cost.</p>
      <p>This move will surely allow Samsung to improve its competitiveness in the entry-level and mid-range segments. Samsung assures the ODM-built phones are exactly the same as the in-built ones so there's no need to worry about a potential drop in quality.</p>
