      <p>Prima revealed that the deals will be live from 25 November so you don’t want to wait until Black Friday, which is on the 29th in order to take advantage of the sale. Keep in mind that other retailers may also bundle a game with the above for a bit more on the price so shop around for the best deals before taking the dive.</p>
      <p>The above sales will be at participating retailers in SA. If they sell Xbox One consoles, it will be on sale during that week at the store.</p>
