      <p>President <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/15/just-in-buhari-returns-to-nigeria-after-private-visit-to-uk/"><u><b>Muhammadu Buhari</b></u></a> on Monday congratulated the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate, David Lyon, for his victory in the Bayelsa State election.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> reports that Lyon was declared the <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/18/inec-declares-apcs-david-lyon-winner-of-bayelsa-election/"><u><b>winner of the Bayelsa election</b></u></a> by INEC Returning Officer and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Benin, Professor Faraday Orunmuwese, on Monday morning, November 18.</p>
      <p>This online news platform understands that Professor Orunmuwese returned the APC candidate as the winner of the keenly contested <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/18/final-bayelsa-election-results-for-all-lgas-declared-by-inec/"><u>Bayelsa election</u></a></b> after scoring the highest number of votes in the poll.</p>
      <p>Lyon scored a total of 352,552 votes to defeat his closest rival and candidate of the <b>Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)</b>, Nigeria’s main opposition party, Duoye Diri, who polled 143,172 votes.</p>
      <p>Reacting in a statement on Monday, Buhari commended Nigerians over their conduct during the voting exercise, despite pockets of unrest recorded in some locations.</p>
      <p><i>“Violence during elections vitiates our commitment to demonstrate to the world and upcoming generation that we are people capable of electing leaders in a peaceful and orderly manner,”</i> he said.</p>
      <p>President Buhari also urged the PDP to approach the courts if they are not satisfied with the outcome of the election.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“The President looks forward to working with the incoming government to improve the lives of the people in Bayelsa State while ensuring the security of lives and property of all citizens.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>“President Buhari urges Governor-elect Lyon to carry other divergent interests along in the next phase of governance, imploring those not satisfied with the outcome of the poll to seek redress through the constitutionally established channels”,</i> the statement added.</p>
