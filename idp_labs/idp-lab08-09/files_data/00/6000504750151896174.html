        <b>Barclays is trialling a distinctly low-tech tool to help stressed out cash-strapped university students: in-branch puppy cuddle sessions.</b>
      </p>
      <p>More than three quarters of students worry about running out of money during their first term, according to research from the bank. Some 61% say that money concerns impact their anxiety levels, with 55% saying it hits their mental health, and 52% their sleep.<br/><br/>Next week, students feeling the pressure can visit a Barclays branch in Manchester to cuddle and play with a litter of puppies, which studies have shown can help reduce stress levels. For those unable to make the session, the bank is planning a live YouTube stream.</p>

      <p>Visitors will also get access to more practical help in the form of chats with Barclays 'money mentors' who will offer advice on budgeting.<br/><br/>While three quarters of students begin with the best of intentions and set themselves a budget while at uni, two fifths completely run out of money during their first term. 10% are broke after Freshers' Week.<br/><br/>Pip Landers-Letts, head, youth, students and graduate propositions, Barclays, says: "We hope the service will help reduce students’ stress levels and encourage them to open up to us about any money concerns they might have, within a safe - and fluffy - space."</p>
