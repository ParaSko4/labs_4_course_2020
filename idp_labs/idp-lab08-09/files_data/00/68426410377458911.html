      <p>Canada’s main stock index snapped an 11-day winning streak to come off its record high on Monday after a report stated that the mood in China over a trade deal with the United States is “pessimistic” due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s reluctance to roll back tariffs.</p>
      <p>At 11:30 a.m. ET, the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&amp;P/TSX composite index was down 10.69 points, or 0.06 per cent, at 17,019.69.</p>
      <p>Five of the index’s 11 major sectors were lower, led by a 2.7-per-cent drop by the healthcare sector.</p>
      <p>The energy sector fell 1.6 per cent as crude prices slid.</p>
      <p>The financials sector slipped 0.2 per cent, while the industrials sector fell 0.1 per cent.</p>
      <p>The materials sector, which includes precious and base metals miners, added 0.9 per cent as gold prices rose 0.3 per cent.</p>
      <p>The U.S. dollar slipped and global equity markets traded little changed on Monday, halting a rally that lifted a key index to just under a new high, after a media report cast fresh doubts on reaching phase one of a U.S.-China trade deal.</p>
      <p>The safe-haven Japanese yen gained and gold prices erased losses after a CNBC report said the mood in Beijing about a trade deal is pessimistic due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s reluctance to roll back tariffs on Chinese imports.</p>
      <p>Stocks on Wall Street were down slightly, halting a rally that had pushed the three major U.S. indexes to record highs on Friday. The dip left MSCI’s all-country world index up 0.11 per cent, close to a peak set in January 2018.</p>
      <p>Chinese state media Xinhua over the weekend said that Washington and Beijing had held “constructive” talks.</p>
      <p>“There is some good news that’s baked into this market, so when we get bad news this market’s going to roll over,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York.</p>
      <p>Mazen Issa, senior FX strategist at TD Securities in New York, said the market over-reacted to the report, as there was nothing substantive that suggested the deal is off or on. “It’s just the ebb and flow” of the news cycle, he said.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.03 points, or 0.01 per cent, to 28,006.92. The S&amp;P 500 lost 1.57 points, or 0.05 per cent, to 3,118.89 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 14.25 points, or 0.17 per cent, to 8,526.58.</p>
      <p>In Europe, the pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.22 per cent and the FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares fell 0.20 per cent.</p>
      <p>Investors hope that tariffs the United States and China have imposed on each other’s goods will be rolled back as they are seen as harming global economic growth.</p>
      <p>Overnight in Asia, stocks closed higher.</p>
      <p>Tokyo’s Nikkei gained 0.49 per cent and China’s blue-chip CSI300 index rose 0.8 per cent after the People’s Bank of China in a surprise move said it was lowering the seven-day reverse repurchase rate.</p>
      <p>The dollar index fell 0.31 per cent, with the euro up 0.33 per cent to $1.1086. The yen strengthened 0.21 per cent versus the greenback at 108.56 per dollar.</p>
      <p>Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last rose 9/32 in price to yield 1.8032 per cent.</p>
      <p>Spot gold was up 0.2 per cent at $1,470.12 an ounce.</p>
      <p>Concerns about plentiful crude supplies in 2020 also weighed on the oil market, which expects the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to extend production cuts in early December to help avoid a new global glut.</p>
      <p>Brent crude futures fell 50 cents to $62.80 per barrel. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude slid 39 cents to $57.33 a barrel.</p>
