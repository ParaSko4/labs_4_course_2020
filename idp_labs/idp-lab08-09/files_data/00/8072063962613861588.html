      <p><b>(PRESS RELEASE) –</b> The National Association of Early Childhood Practitioners in St. Lucia will be celebrating Universal Children’s Day on Tuesday 19th November in the South, and on Wednesday 20th November in the North and the theme for this celebration is “Children and Education: Towards Education 2030.</p>
      <p>The National Association of Early Childhood Practitioners believe in improving the welfare of children; our members and non-members of the Association will be coming together to celebrate the rights of our children both in the north and south of St.Lucia.</p>
      <p>In the South, the day will commence with a church service at the Victory Pentecostal Church in Cedar Heights, Vieux Fort from 10 a.m. This will be followed by a few fun activities planned for the children. Children from Dennery to Vieux Fort will be in attendance.</p>
      <p>In the North, the service commences at 10.00 a.m. at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Castries and this will be followed by a match to the Dereck Walcott Square.</p>
      <p>Children from each early childhood education center will be reciting prayers, poems, and short skits and most importantly showcasing their rights as a child under the UN Convention Rights of the Child.</p>
