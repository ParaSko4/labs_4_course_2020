      <p>Former General Secretary of the Christian Council of Ghana, Rev. Dr. Opuni Frimpong has appealed to the government to postpone the scheduled referendum.<br/><br/>He says the government must engage various stakeholders and have a broader discussion on the referendum before urging Ghanaians to vote a 'Yes' or 'No'.<br/><br/>Speaking on <b>Okay FM’s</b> 'Ade Akye Abia' program, he explained that the current position of the various political parties on the referendum is gradually driving the country and that a broader consultation should be encouraged.<br/><br/><i>"Ghanaians should be educated on the referendum than allowing politicians to confuse them. But I believe that if the government postpones the referendum and engages more, Ghanaians will have a better appreciation of their position,"</i> he said.<br/><br/>The National House of Chiefs is on fire as the traditional rulers tear each other apart over their position on the upcoming referendum that could introduce multi-party sponsorship of candidates at the local level provided the electorate votes ‘Yes’ on December 17.<br/><br/>A statement by Togbe Afede XIV and Nana Kweku Ewusi VII, President and Vice-President respectively, opposing the December referendum, has drawn fury, denial and harsh remarks among the top traditional rulers.<br/><br/>Ogyeahoho Yaw Gyebi II, Paramount Chief of Sefwi Anwhiaso Traditional Area and President of the Western Regional House of Chiefs, who doubles as Chairman of the Governance Committee of the National House of Chiefs, described the statement as bogus and arbitrary and added that it smacked of ‘drunkenness and abuse of power’ by Togbe Afede and Nana Kweku Ewusi.<br/><br/>The Okyehene and other prominent Chiefs from the Eastern Region have also distanced themselves from the statement made by the President of the House of Chiefs and his Vice.<br/><br/>But Togbe Afede who does not appear ready to countenance dissent on the matter has described the reaction of his colleagues as consistent with ‘dishonesty’.<br/><br/><b>Watch video below</b></p>
