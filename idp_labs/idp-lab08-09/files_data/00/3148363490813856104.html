      <p>In May of 2015, Alec Ingram was <a href="https://www.ksdk.com/article/news/local/alec-ingram-sports-cars-funeral/63-22be5e8c-725c-4ed7-ae07-b90d2a606fd7">diagnosed</a> with Osteosarcoma bone cancer. Sadly, he passed away a few weeks ago at the age of 14, according to NBC 5.</p>
      <p>The teenager, who had a huge love for sports cars, told his family that his final wish was to have them lining his funeral procession.</p>
      <p>Sunday morning, nearly 4,500 drivers from all over the country were expected to take part in honoring the young man.</p>
      <p>“Beginning around noon; the funeral is around 1 p.m. But we’ll begin shutting down streets around 11,” <a href="https://fox2now.com/2019/11/15/washington-missouri-police-to-grant-teens-last-wish-of-a-sports-car-funeral-procession/">said</a> Sgt. Steve Sitzes of the Washington Police Department.</p>
      <p>“We have anywhere from 3,200 to 4,500 cars expected. This child loved classic cars and muscle cars. I know it’s going to be an inconvenience for some but this is what this child wanted and we’re trying to make that happen,” he said.</p>
      <p>Police departments in Eureka and Union are expected to help with the procession, along with the Missouri State Highway Patrol, according to Fox 2 Now.</p>
      <p>Dana Manley, who created a Facebook group called Sports Cars for Alec that has over 8,000 members, <a href="https://fox4kc.com/2019/11/11/local-car-enthusiasts-plan-to-join-funeral-procession-for-missouri-teen-who-lost-cancer-fight/">said</a> the event is going to be massive.</p>
      <p>“I have people from California, Washington State, Michigan, from all over the country to fulfill this boy’s last wish. It’s going to be enormous.”</p>
      <p>Tracey Anderson, a member of the group Rides for Hope KC, said nothing could stop her from making the day special for Alec and his family.</p>
      <p>“It’s not every day that we get a chance to help somebody fulfill their last wish, and it’s not every day that a 14-year-old boy, who has cancer, asks you to do it. But when he does, you show up,” she concluded.</p>
      <p>Sunday morning, the Facebook group Eureka, Missouri Community <a href="https://www.facebook.com/eurekamissouri/photos/pb.1492909541013245.-2207520000.0./2178553972448795/?type=3&amp;theater">stated</a> that drivers were already lining up to make their way over to the funeral procession.</p>
      <p>“The turnout so far is unreal! Sports Cars For Alec will be making their trip shortly towards Washington MO,” the post read, along with an aerial photo of the cars.</p>
      <p>Manley said Alec’s family is grateful for all the support they have received from the community and from people all over the country.</p>
      <p>“They say as hard as it is to have lost a son, just seeing the support they’re getting is giving them so much joy,” she stated.</p>
