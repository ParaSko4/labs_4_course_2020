      <p>BOSTON (AP) - A bill that would bar Massachusetts drivers from using hand-held cellphones behind the wheel is inching closer to final approval by state lawmakers.</p>
      <p>A compromise version of the bill was released Monday. The Massachusetts House and Senate had approved separate versions.</p>
      <p>The bill would prohibit drivers from holding cellphones while driving - but would allow hands-free cellphones. Massachusetts already bans texting while driving.</p>
      <p>The bill would impose fines of $100 for a first offense, $250 for a second offense and $500 for a subsequent offense.</p>
      <p>The bill requires the Registry of Motor Vehicles to collect data from every traffic citation, including the age, race and gender of the driver, without identifying the driver.</p>
