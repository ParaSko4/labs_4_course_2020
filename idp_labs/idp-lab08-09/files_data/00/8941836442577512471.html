      <p>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) - A Tucson man convicted of negligent homicide in a 2016 car crash that killed the younger sister of former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor has been sentenced to nearly five years in prison.</p>
      <p>Pima County prosecutors say Jarrad Barnes was credited with 719 days of time served at Monday’s sentencing and he has just under three years left to serve.</p>
      <p>Barnes also was convicted last April of criminal damage, endangerment, driving with an illegal drug and possession of marijuana. He was acquitted of manslaughter and driving under the influence.</p>
      <p>Authorities say 77-year-old Ann Day suffered fatal injuries after her vehicle was struck head-on by a car that crossed a median in May 2016.</p>
