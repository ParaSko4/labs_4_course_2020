      <h1>European pre-orders for the Motorola Razr 2019 start next month, here's the price</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/author.php3?idAuthor=12" target="_blank">Peter</a></address>
      <p>Europeans are looking at a €1,600 price tag for the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_razr_2019-9630.php">Motorola Razr 2019</a> – slightly less than a <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_razr_2019_european_price_leaks-news-40143.php">leaked report</a> suggested. However, Motorola leadership didn’t offer more details, saying only that “select markets” will get it. Here’s what we know so far.</p>
      <p>British carrier <a href="https://shop.ee.co.uk/motorola-razr">EE</a> has claimed exclusivity on the phone in the UK. Pre-orders will start in December, but the phone won’t ship until January. The SIM-free price in pounds is still TBD (it should be around £1,400).</p>
      <p>Motorola Razr 2019 pre-orders in Italy are set to start on December 4, sales will likely kick off in January again. We haven’t heart anything about carrier exclusives yet.</p>

      <p>Judging by rumors, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands will join the party too. The Swedish launch in particular is reportedly set for January 24.</p>
