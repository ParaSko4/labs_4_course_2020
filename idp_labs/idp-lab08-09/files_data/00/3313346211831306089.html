    <meta property="og:description" content="Oculus Link, the program Oculus announced earlier in the year to make Rift games playable on the inside-out Oculus Quest headset, has launched into open beta. With that, a portion of Oculus Quest owners that have access to a compatible PC are able to essentially tether their otherwise wireless headsets to use content and games originally designed for the PC-tethered Oculus Rift line. Rift games on the Quest won’t look or run quite as well as they would on the recently-overhauled Oculus Rift S headset, but by opening the portable Quest up to PC-tethered games Oculus hopes to make VR a more appealing and accessible buy for players, while also potentially expanding the market for PC-based VR games."/>

      <p>Oculus Link, the program <a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/351126/Oculus_Rift_games_are_coming_to_Quest_via_Oculus_Link_this_November.php">Oculus announced earlier in the year</a> to make Rift games playable on the inside-out Oculus Quest headset, has launched into open beta.</p>

      <p>Rift games on the Quest won’t look or run quite as well as they would on the recently-overhauled Oculus Rift S headset, but by opening the portable Quest up to PC-tethered games Oculus hopes to make VR a more appealing and accessible buy for players, while also potentially expanding the market for PC-based VR games.</p>
      <p>Oculus notes that a Link-compatible Quest-to-PC connection can be made with most high-quality USB 3 cables, as the official Oculus branded offering won’t launch until later this year. The company has more details on exactly which PCs are supported as well <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/play-rift-content-on-quest-with-oculus-link-available-now-in-beta/">on its blog</a>. More supported systems, as well as availability for the official Oculus Link cable, are expected to roll out in the future.</p>
