      <p>Ireland's matchday squad for Monday night's crucial Euro 2020 qualifier against Denmark has been announced.</p>
      <p>Jack Byrne and Troy Parrott, both of whom played in last week's win against New Zealand, have been included.</p>
      <p>Callum O'Dowda and Scott Hogan are the two to miss out.</p>
      <p>Shane Duffy will tonight captain the team for the first time.</p>
      <p>A victory for Ireland will see Mick McCarthy's side qualify for next summer's Euro 2020 finals.</p>
      <p>However, if they do not beat Denmark tonight, Ireland can still qualify for the finals via the playoffs which take place at the end of March. A spot in the playoffs was secured over the weekend.</p>
