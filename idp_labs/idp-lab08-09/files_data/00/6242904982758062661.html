      </p>
      <p>Appiah was given a six-month contract which is set to elapse in December after his initial two-year deal run out prior to the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt.</p>
      <p>Many have suggested that the 59-year-old gaffer should be shown the exit following his failure to guide the team to glory at the competition.</p>
      <p>“The most important thing is being on contract until the end of December. I want to make sure I do the best that I can. As to whether I would love to continue or the management would like me to continue, I think that will be decided after,” Appiah said in an interview with Joy Sports’ Benedict Owusu.</p>
