      <h2>Noel says every tweet posted by his "moron" brother is a "nail in the coffin".</h2>

      <p>Noel Gallagher has said that an Oasis reunion is more unlikely than ever thanks to his brother Liam's regular outbursts on Twitter. </p>
      <p>The brothers have been fueding since Oasis split up in 2009, and Noel says every tweet posted by his "moron" brother is a "nail in the coffin" for the chance of a band reunion. </p>
      <p>Liam frequently uses social media air his views about Noel, recently posting: "We all know your desperate to hang out with your little bro it’s just your Mrs won’t let ya oh well as you were LGX x". </p>
      <p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.bigissue.com/latest/noel-gallagher-labour-party-is-the-biggest-disgrace-of-all/">The Big Issue</a>, Noel said: "It’s strange behaviour for someone who is gagging for me to pick up the phone and say let’s do it. </p>
      <p>"He’d put his whole life on hold to get Oasis back together. But every tweet he sends out, it’s another nail in the coffin of that idea.</p>
      <p>"If you think for one minute I am going to share a stage with you after what you’ve said you are f**king more of a moron than you look."</p>
      <p>The comments come after Noel recently admitted that he'd rather have Boris Johnson than Liam for a brother. “I would say Boris is more entertaining," he said. "His use of the English language is more superior."</p>
      <p>Last week Noel released his new single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Rb0oIXrsqQ">Wandering Star</a> from his upcoming EP Blue Moon Rising, which follows on March 6 2020. </p>
