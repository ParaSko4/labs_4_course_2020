      <p>Ellyse Perry, the Australia all-rounder and Sydney Sixers captain, has suffered a low-grade AC injury in her right shoulder, which will sideline her for one to three weeks.</p>
      <p>Perry, who sustained the injury while fielding for Sydney Sixers in the Women's Big Bash League on Sunday, 17 November, has been ruled out of their next clash against Hobart Hurricanes. Depending on results from further assessments, she may have to spend a longer stint on the sidelines.</p>
      <p>"Perry will miss this Wednesday’s match at North Sydney Oval before undergoing further assessment later this week. Club medical staff will provide further information then," the Sydney Sixers announced on Monday.</p>

      <p>Perry sustained the injury when he landed awkwardly on her shoulder in her team's match against Melbourne Renegades, a thrilling affair which finished in the Renegades securing a last-ball win, courtesy of a Courtney Webb six.</p>
      <p>Sixers are currently placed third on the points table and Perry has been central to the team's form. She has slammed 469 runs at 93.80 in just nine innings, including four half-centuries. Along with being their leading run-scorer in the tournament so far, Perry has also picked up four wickets with her right-arm pace.</p>
      <p>While Perry might have to sit out the remainder of the league stage, she is expected to be fully fit in time for the WBBL finals should her side make it that far.</p>
