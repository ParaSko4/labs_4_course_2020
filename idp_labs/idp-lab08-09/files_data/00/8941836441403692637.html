      <p>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A church and anti-abortion pregnancy centers want to strike down New York’s new law that prevents employers from discriminating against employees over their reproductive health decisions.</p>
      <p>The groups filed a lawsuit this month asking a federal court to declare the state law unconstitutional.</p>
      <p>The National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, CompassCare Pregnancy Services and the First Bible Baptist Church claim New York’s law violates their civil rights.</p>
      <p>Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s spokesman called the lawsuit “frivolous.” Democratic Attorney General Letitia James’ office didn’t respond to request for comment.</p>

        <p>The law was signed this month. It prohibits discrimination based on an employee’s reproductive health decision, including the use of any particular drug, device or medical service.</p>
