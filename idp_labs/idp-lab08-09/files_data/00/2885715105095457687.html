      <p>In an effort to tackle the issue of declining interest among youth from the Sompura community for their traditional work of temple architecture and construction, the Sompura Sthapatya Foundation launched ‘Udaan’ programme Sunday.</p>
      <p>As per the records with the Sompura Sthapatya Foundation formed three months ago, out of an estimated total population of nearly 4,500 to 5,000 people belonging to the community across the country, only 1,000 are into temple construction.</p>
      <p>“To overcome this, the foundation under the programme will inspire the next generation youths to develop business entrepreneurship and adopt new technologies,” Manoj Sompura, president of the foundation, said.</p>
      <p>“Today the youth after completing their education are getting into jobs. They prefer easy jobs and office work over hard work and field job. Special sessions by experts on different subjects will be organised in the coming weeks as part of the programme. This will motivate our youth to take up our traditional profession, with the help of modern technology and science,” said Rajesh Sompura, foundation’s managing trustee.</p>
      <p>Through special lectures, seminars as well as visits, the foundation aims to introduce the work done through centuries by the community members to its young generations. “We also want our youth to utilise initiatives like the Stone Artisan Park Training Institute at Ambaji and Dhrangadhra launched by Prime Minister <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/narendra-modi">Narendra Modi</a> as the Sompura temple architecture uses only stones in construction of temple,” said Kiran Trivedi from Kiran Trivedi Group and a Sompura community member.</p>
