        <b>The Spain national team coach, Robert Moreno, decided to cancel the press conference after the game against Romania so that he did not have to speak about his future.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Spain</b> won by five goals to nil and<b> head into the Euro 2020 competition undefeated,</b> but before the game against Romania, news came out that Robert Moreno was not going to continue as Spain coach for the Euro's next year.</p>
      <p>Once the game had finished, and with the win under his belt and the press conference room full, <b>Robert Moreno decided to not give a press conference</b> in order to avoid having to explain what is happening in the near future with the Spanish national team and its coach.</p>
      <p>This took everybody by surprise, and maybe suggests that <b>his possible departure from the Spanish national team is more real</b> and has only increased the rumours about Luis Enrique's possible return.</p>

      <p>The journalist, Juanma Castana already said with 'COPE' before the start of the game that <b>Luis Enrique is likely to take back the reigns of the Spanish national team</b> and manage Spain in the Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Some players, such as Gerard Moreno showed support for the current coach and stated that <b>they will "fight to the death" with him </b>whatever happens.</p>
      <p>After Robert Moreno's reaction, we will have to wait and see how the Spanish Football Federation act in the next few hours, as it could mean a definite departure for Robert Moreno,Â who <b>wouldn't look too kindly on having to leave </b>after an impeccable classification.</p>
