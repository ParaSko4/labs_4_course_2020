      <h1>Are Gun Makers To Blame for Mass Shootings? Can They Be Sued?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:30:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 00:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">Timothy D. Lytton</a></address>
      <p>Gun-makers have long refused to take responsibility for their role in this epidemic. That may be about to change.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/12/778487920/supreme-court-allows-sandy-hook-families-case-against-remington-to-proceed">U.S. Supreme Court on Nov. 12 refused to block</a> a lawsuit filed by the families of the Sandy Hook Elementary mass shooting victims, clearing the way for the litigation to proceed. Remington Arms, which manufactured and sold the semiautomatic rifle used in the attack, had hoped the <a href="https://lawcenter.giffords.org/gun-laws/policy-areas/other-laws-policies/gun-industry-immunity/">broad immunity the industry has enjoyed for years</a> would shield it from any liability.</p>
      <p>The prospect of more claims from victims of mass shootings puts new pressure on the gun industry to reconsider the way it does business.</p>
      <p><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yQUI6yEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">My research over the past 20 years</a> on lawsuits against the gun industry examines how the threat of civil liability has the potential to promote safer gun designs, encourage more responsible marketing practice and reduce the risk of illegal retail sales.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The end of Immunity</b>
      </p>
      <p>A 2006 law called the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/chapter-105">Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act</a> grants gun manufacturers broad immunity from civil lawsuits that arise out of the criminal misuse of a weapon.</p>
      <p>However, this immunity does not apply where a manufacturer “knowingly violated a state or federal statute applicable to the sale or marketing” of a firearm.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.jud.ct.gov/external/supapp/Cases/AROcr/CR331/331CR865.pdf">Sandy Hook families allege</a> that Remington, by marketing certain guns to civilians, engaged in “unethical” business methods in violation of the <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/DCP/Trade-Practices-Division/About-the-Connecticut-Unfair-Trade-Practices-Act-CUTPA">Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act</a>. Specifically, they argued Remington “marketed, advertised and promoted the Bushmaster XM15-E2S for civilians to use to carry out offensive, military-style combat missions against their perceived enemies.”</p>
