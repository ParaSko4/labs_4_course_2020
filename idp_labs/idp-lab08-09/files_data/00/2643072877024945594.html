      <h1>Ekiti State University To ‘Sack’ Over 500 Staff</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Faderera Falade</a></address>
      <p>The <b><a href="http://www.naijanews.com/topic/eksu/"><u>Ekiti State University (EKSU)</u></a>,</b> Ado Ekiti are presently living in fear due to unconfirmed reports that the institution’s management is allegedly making plans in the secret to fire about 500 of its staff.</p>
      <p>It is also alleged that staff who may be sacked are those employed during the tenure of EKSU’s immediate past Vice Chancellor, Prof Samuel Oye Bandele, according to multiple sources.</p>
      <p>Some of the professors who attained professorial posturing during Bamidele’s tenure are allegedly going to be demoted over allegations that academic due process was not strictly adhered to in obtaining their elevations, sources say.</p>
      <p>According to an anonymous source, the new management, headed by Pro- Chancellor and Chairman of Council, Prof Bamitale Omole, has consistently complained about an overbloated workforce at the university, and has pushed for prompt action to be taken to address it.</p>
