      <p>Far from the pull of the Sun, giant planets are the dominant sources of gravity, and collectively, they boast dozens upon dozens of moons.</p>
      <p>Some of those moons formed alongside their planets and never went anywhere; others were captured later, then locked into orbits dictated by their planets. Some orbit in the opposite direction their planets rotate; others swap orbits with each other as if to avoid collision.</p>
      <p>The Neptune system consists of seven regular inner moons, Triton, Nereid, and five irregular outer moons.</p>
      <p>Inner moons Naiad and Thalassa were discovered by NASA’s Voyager 2 spacecraft during the 1989 flyby of Neptune.</p>
      <p>They are about 60 miles (100 km) in length and are true partners, orbiting only about 1,150 miles (1,850 km) apart.</p>
      <p>But they never get that close to each other; Naiad’s orbit is tilted and perfectly timed. Every time it passes the slower-moving Thalassa, the two are about 2,200 miles (3,540 km) apart.</p>
      <p>In this perpetual choreography, Naiad swirls around Neptune every seven hours, while Thalassa, on the outside track, takes seven and a half hours.</p>
      <p>An observer sitting on Thalassa would see Naiad in an orbit that varies wildly in a zigzag pattern, passing by twice from above and then twice from below.</p>
      <p>This up, up, down, down pattern repeats every time Naiad gains four laps on Thalassa. Although the dance may appear odd, it keeps the orbits stable.</p>
      <p>Dr. Marina Brozović, a researcher at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and colleagues discovered the unusual orbital pattern using analysis of observations by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope.</p>
      <p>“We refer to this repeating pattern as a resonance. There are many different types of ‘dances’ that planets, moons and asteroids can follow, but this one has never been seen before,” Dr. Brozović said.</p>

      <p>So how did Naiad and Thalassa end up together — but apart? It’s thought that the original satellite system was disrupted when Neptune captured its giant moon, Triton, and that these inner moons and rings formed from the leftover debris.</p>
      <p>“We suspect that Naiad was kicked into its tilted orbit by an earlier interaction with one of Neptune’s other inner moons,” Dr. Brozović said.</p>
      <p>“Only later, after its orbital tilt was established, could Naiad settle into this unusual resonance with Thalassa.”</p>
      <p>The study also provides the first hint about the internal composition of Neptune’s inner moons.</p>
      <p>The scientists used the Hubble observations to compute their mass and, thus, their densities — which were close to that of water ice.</p>
      <p>“We are always excited to find these co-dependencies between moons,” said Dr. Mark Showalter, a planetary astronomer at the SETI Institute.</p>
      <p>“Naiad and Thalassa have probably been locked together in this configuration for a very long time, because it makes their orbits more stable. They maintain the peace by never getting too close.”</p>
