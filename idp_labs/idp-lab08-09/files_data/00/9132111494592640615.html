      <p>A police source told the Daily Graphic that the suspect, Mary Gladys Obi, a Nigerian, was monitored for some time until the early hours of yesterday when the police arrested her.</p>
      <p>The victims told the police that Obi brought them to Takoradi some months ago and that on arrival, she took them to her brothel, where they were supposed to lodge and start work.</p>
      <p>Commercial sex</p>
      <p>The girls said to their shock, they were forced to sleep with men, while the suspect collected money from the men.</p>
      <p>The police said their investigations had revealed that the suspect lured the girls into Ghana in order to make money out of them through prostitution.</p>
      <p>Victims safe</p>
      <p>The Western Regional Police Commander, Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCOP) Redeemer Vincent Dedjoe, confirmed the story and said the suspect was in police custody.</p>
      <p>He said the victims were being taken care of by the Domestic Violence and Victims Support Unit of the Ghana Police Service.</p>
