        <b>Bundesliga relegation candidates Mainz have announced Achim Beierlorzer as their new head coach, just nine days after the 51-year-old was fired by fellow strugglers Cologne. </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Beierlorzer, who led Cologne to promotion as caretaker coach last season</b>, was sacked earlier this month after a three-game losing run which started with defeat to Sandro Schwarz's Mainz side on October 25.</p>
      <p>Yet he now replaces Schwarz, who was dismissed by Mainz after a 3-2 home defeat to promoted side Union Berlin a week ago.</p>
      <p>"<b>Achim Beierlorzer is a typical coach for Mainz</b>," sporting director Rouven Schroeder told the club's website.</p>
