      <p>Noel Gallagher has revealed every tweet from his brother Liam is a “nail in the coffin” of Oasis reunion hopes.</p>
      <p>The guitarist and songwriter said his younger sibling would put his life on hold to reunite the band.</p>
      <p>But Noel said he would not get back on stage with his “moron” brother.</p>

      <p>Liam became embroiled in a feud with his sister-in-law Sara MacDonald, and was alleged to have sent threatening messages.</p>
      <p>Noel, defending his wife, said his brother’s comments were destroying the chances of an Oasis reunion.</p>
      <p>He told The Big Issue: “It’s strange behaviour for someone who is gagging for me to pick up the phone and say let’s do it.</p>
      <p>“He’d put his whole life on hold to get Oasis back together.</p>
      <p>“But every tweet he sends out its another nail in the coffin of that idea.”</p>

      <p>Addressing his brother directly, he added: “If you think for one minute I am going to share a stage with you after what you’ve said you are f****** more of a moron than you look.”</p>
      <p>Noel said that people keep trying to tell him he is loved by his brother, but the High Flying Birds star believes Liam’s comments come from “a place of hate”.</p>
      <p>The guitarist conceded that his younger sibling was selling more records and more tickets than him, and advised him to “ride it until the wheels come off”.</p>
      <p>Noel believes despite his misgivings over Brexit, that the referendum vote should now be honoured. He also delivered a broadside to a climate conscious generation he believes are as culpable as their scapegoated elders.</p>
      <p>He said of environmentalism: “I don’t think the world is gonna change until it is at the absolute brink of disaster and then we will pull back.</p>
      <p>“And in any case, our generation invented the internet. That generation should invent something that saves the f****** world.</p>
      <p>“They’re the first generation, actually, who have grown up with gadgets, driven round in 4×4’s and had f****** air conditioning all their lives. So actually if it’s anybody’s fault it’s their f****** fault.”</p>
      <p>The full interview is available in The Big Issue, out now.</p>
