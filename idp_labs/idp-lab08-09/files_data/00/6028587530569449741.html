      <p>Russia has returned to Ukraine three ships seized a year ago following a confrontation between the two navies in the Kerch Strait. The move suggests a desire to improve relations ahead of an expected meeting of the two countries' presidents in Decemberâ€“but comes with a warning from Moscow that it will "continue to harshly suppress any provocations at its borders."The Kerch Strait is the waterway between Russia and Crimea, which it annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Since then, the territory has been an ongoing source of tension between the two countries. That tension came to head in November 2018 when the Russian navy fired on, and then captured, the Ukrainian ships as they tried to pass through the strait.</p>
      <p>Russia accused the vessels of <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-ukraine-crisis-russia-shots/ukrainian-ships-in-kerch-strait-ignored-warning-shots-russian-fsb-idUKKCN1NV2EU">illegally entering Russian waters</a>. Ukraine insisted they had done nothing wrong.</p>

        <b>Putin and Zelenskiy to meet in Paris</b>
      </p>
      <p>The return of the ships follows the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesrodgerseurope/2019/09/07/after-secret-talks-russia-and-ukraine-agree-prisoner-exchange/#28b88dc325f5">release in September of the ships' crews</a>, and comes ahead of an expected <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/world/europe/putin-zelensky-ukraine.html?auth=login-email&amp;login=email">meeting in Paris December 9</a> of the two countries' presidents.</p>
      <p>The two leaders, Vladimir Putin of Russia and Volodymyr Zelenskiy, are due to attend a summit to seek an end to the conflict in eastern Ukraine. It will be their first meeting. Zelenskiy, a former television comedy actor, was only elected in April. His campaign pledges included a promise to end the fighting.</p>

        <b>Russia keeps up the rhetoric</b>
      </p>
      <p>The release of the ships may be seen as a conciliatory gesture ahead of the Paris talks, but Russian rhetoric remains robust. A <a href="https://www.mid.ru/en/foreign_policy/news/-/asset_publisher/cKNonkJE02Bw/content/id/3902958">statement from the Foreign Ministry in Moscow</a> recalled some of the more bellicose phrases Russia used to describe the original incident, accusing Ukraine of a "deliberate provocation" and "a crime."</p>
      <p>The 2014 annexation of Crimea led to widespread western sanctions against Russia. Russia was <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/24/politics/obama-europe-trip/index.html">expelled from the G8 group of leading industrial nations</a>.</p>
      <p>While Ukraine demands the return of Crimea, Russia clearly has no intention of complying. In March 2019, Putin marked the fifth anniversary of the annexation with <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/russia-marks-5-years-since-crimea-annexation/a-47963977">a celebratory visit to the peninsula.</a></p>
      <p>So while the return of the ships may be seen as a sign of goodwill, there is a long way to go if the two countries are one day to resume normal relations.</p>
