      <p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) - A new federal lawsuit challenges a Jim Crow-era law in Mississippi that requires naturalized U.S. citizens to show proof of citizenship before registering to vote.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit was filed Monday by the Mississippi Immigrants Rights Alliance.</p>
      <p>A Mississippi law enacted in 1924 requires proof of citizenship from naturalized citizens. But people born in the U.S. must only check a box on a voter-registration form to say they are citizens.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit says the system is unconstitutional because it treats one group of citizens differently from others.</p>

        <p>The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law is among the groups representing the plaintiffs. It says in a news release that Mississippi is the only state that requires naturalized citizens to prove citizenship before registering to vote.</p>
