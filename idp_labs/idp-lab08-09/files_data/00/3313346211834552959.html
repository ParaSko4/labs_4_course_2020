      <p>Google has expanded its Stadia launch lineup to 22 games, mere hours before the cloud-gaming platform officially rolls out on November 19.</p>
      <p>Stadia was <a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/353768/Stadia_launch_includes_familiar_lineup_one_exclusive.php">initially slated to arrive with just 12 titles</a>, but it looks like the company was able to finalize some last minute details with its partners to almost double its launch catalog.</p>
      <p>"Excited to announce that we are increasing the Day One launch line-up of titles for Google Stadia - we now have 22 games launching with the platform on Tuesday. Huge thank you to our game developer and publisher partners for bringing more titles," <a href="https://twitter.com/MrPhilHarrison/status/1196245130488905728">tweeted Stadia boss Phil Harrison</a>.</p>
      <p>"Yes, we were perhaps a little conservative in our forecast last week, and (most importantly) our partners did an awesome job getting last few kinks ironed out and through testing."</p>
      <p>The revised list of launch titles (shown below) includes some fair big additions like <i>Football Manager 2020</i>, <i>Grid</i>, and <i>Metro Exodus</i>.</p>
      <p>Google is hoping to add some other notable names to that lineup, <i>such as Borderlands 3</i> and <i>Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Breakpoint</i>, before the end of the year. As revealed in a <a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/353947/Google_plans_to_roll_out_Stadia_features_weekly_after_a_barebones_Nov_19_launch.php">recent (and rather bizarre) Reddit 'ask me anything' session</a>, certain key features like State Share and Crowd Play will also be rolled out after launch.</p>
