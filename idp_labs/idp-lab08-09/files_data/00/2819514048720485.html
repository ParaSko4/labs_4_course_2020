      <p>New Zealand is a key area for understanding the ancient history of penguins.</p>
      <p>Fossils found there range in age from Paleocene up to Pleistocene, constituting a period that spans more than 60 million years.</p>
      <p>The country’s fossil record includes many genera and species of ‘giant’ penguins (i.e., larger than living penguins), such as <i>Kairuku</i>, <i>Pachydyptes</i>, <i>Palaeeudyptes</i> and <i>Kumimanu</i>.</p>
      <p>The ancient giants differed from their living descendants in the length of their front limbs and elongated beaks, perhaps suggesting differences in ecological roles when compared with living species.</p>
      <p>The new fossil, which belongs to the genus <i>Kairuku</i>, was found in an Oligocene silty mudstone in Kawhia Harbour, New Zealand’s North Island.</p>
      <p>“The Kawhia giant penguin is mostly complete and largely articulated in life position, which helps a great deal with reconstructing the relatively long and slender body,” said <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Simone_Giovanardi">Simone Giovanardi</a>, a Ph.D. student at Massey University Albany.</p>
      <p>The forelimbs of the new penguin are almost identical in size when compared with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kairuku_grebneffi"><i>Kairuku grebneffi</i></a>, a similarly-aged giant penguin from the South Island of New Zealand.</p>
      <p>However, its hindlimbs are significantly longer, exceeding in length all previously described specimens of the <i>Kairuku</i> genus.</p>
      <p>“Moreover, the specimen presents a mixture of characters that show a transitional state between the ancestral body plan found in other Eocene-Oligocene giant penguins and the body plan found in <i>Kairuku</i>, providing insight into the diversification of giant penguins,” Giovanardi and colleagues said.</p>
      <p>The scientists reported the discovery October 9, 2019 at the <a href="http://vertpaleo.org/Annual-Meeting-2019/Annual-Meeting-Home.aspx"><i>79th Annual Meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology</i></a> in Brisbane, Australia.</p>
