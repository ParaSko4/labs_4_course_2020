      <h1>Ronaldo Reveals Why He Was Substituted During Juventus Last Two Matches</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Enioluwa Adeniyi</a></address>
      <p>Juventus forward, <a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/12/cristiano-ronaldo-risks-two-year-ban-for-leaving-the-stadium-before-the-end-of-the-match/"><u><b>Cristiano Ronaldo</b></u></a>, has revealed why he was substituted during his side’s last two matches against AC Milan and Lokomotiv Moscow.</p>
      <p>The Portugal international stated that <b>Maurizio Sarri</b> substituted him because he was carrying an injury.</p>
      <p>Recall that the former Real Madrid player was removed few minutes into the second half against AC Milan, while he was taken-off against Lokomotiv Moscow in the Champions League a few days earlier.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo while speaking with A Bola after scoring in Portugal’s 2-0 victory over Luxembourg in a Euro 2020 qualifier encounter on Sunday, said: <i>“In the last three weeks I have been playing with limitations.”</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“Everyone knows that I don’t like to be substituted, but there was no problem in my gestures after the change. I tried to help Juventus by playing injured.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Nobody likes to be replaced, but I understood it because I wasn’t in such good shape.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Ronaldo added: <i>“I sacrificed myself for the team. We could have missed out [on Euro 2020]. Thankfully, I haven’t been injured much in my career but it can happen.”</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“It’s a pain that prevents me from being 100%, but I always try to play. They created a big controversy where it didn’t need to exist. I’ll be back to 100% soon.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Ronaldo will now hope to lead Juventus to victory when they take on Atalanta in the Serie A fixture on Saturday.</p>
