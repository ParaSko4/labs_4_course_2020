      <h1>Amazon JEDI lawsuit threatens to ensnare Donald Trump</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/ben-wolfgang/" target="_blank">Ben Wolfgang</a></address>
      <p>The White House faces a “very ugly” legal battle with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/amazon/">Amazon</a> over the handling of a massive contract to handle the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pentagon/">Pentagon</a>’s vast cloud computing needs, experts say, and top administration officials ultimately may have to reveal under oath whether President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> personally interfered in the process.</p>
      <p>The fight is already shaping up as a battle of economic and political super heavyweights, with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Mr. Trump</a> making clear his lack of respect for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/amazon-web-services/">Amazon</a> founder <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeffrey-p-bezos/">Jeff Bezos</a> and his business empire, which happens to include The Washington Post.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/defence-department/">Defense Department</a> last month awarded the 10-year, $10 billion military cloud computing contract to Microsoft, surprising observers who believed <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/amazon-web-services/">Amazon</a> was the clear front-runner. With <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/amazon-web-services/">Amazon Web Services</a> now lodging a formal protest and alleging clear political bias that prevented the company from winning the lucrative deal, attention turns to a potentially explosive legal proceeding likely to ensnare the president, Secretary of Defense <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mark-t-esper/">Mark T. Esper</a> and other top officials across the federal government.</p>
      <p>The fight over the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) program is gearing up during impeachment proceedings in the House and almost surely will produce another major legal headache for the White House. Analysts say a court battle between the administration and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/amazon-web-services/">Amazon</a> would center on whether <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Mr. Trump</a> broke historical precedent and directed the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/defence-department/">Defense Department</a> to select Microsoft.</p>
      <p>The legal fight will likely result in sworn depositions of top administration officials, the release of internal memos and emails regarding JEDI, and other information that may shine a light on what influence, if any, the White House had over the process.</p>

      <p>“This is going to get very ugly,” said Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former official in the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/defence-department/">Defense Department</a> and the Office of Management and Budget. “The difference is deciding who gets a contract as opposed to the conditions of the contract. In other words, if <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> really did interfere in the source selection and push it toward Microsoft or away from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/amazon-web-services/">Amazon</a>, that would be very improper and I would suspect illegal.”</p>
      <p>Past presidents have had a hand in the structure of contract terms or in the technical requirements of companies bidding. But analysts say a president has never played a direct role in deciding who wins the award.</p>
      <p>For <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/amazon-web-services/">Amazon</a>, the loss of the JEDI contract means the loss of billions of dollars. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/amazon/">Its</a> rival Microsoft, meanwhile, will be at the forefront of technological advancement in the military. The JEDI contract will cover the storage and processing of huge amounts of classified <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pentagon/">Pentagon</a> data, and Microsoft will now be in an unprecedented high-tech partnership with the U.S. military.</p>
      <p>The JEDI program, informally known as the military’s “war cloud,” will enable the immediate sharing of data to battlefields around the world and will greatly aid the U.S. military in virtually all of its operations.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/amazon-web-services/">Amazon</a> and Microsoft were the only two companies left in the running by the time of the award last month.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Denying interference</b>
        </p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/amazon/">Amazon</a> claims nearly half of the U.S. cloud computing market. It was the only bidder for the JEDI contract to hold the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pentagon/">Pentagon</a>’s security clearance classification, leading to widespread predictions in the industry that the company was a strong favorite to win the competition.</p>
        <p>The White House did not respond to a request for comment from The Washington Times on Monday, though officials have said the president was not involved in the selection process. Defense officials also have downplayed the notion of interference from the White House.</p>
        <p>“I am confident it was conducted freely and fairly without any type of outside influence,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mark-t-esper/">Mr. Esper</a> said during a news conference last week. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mark-t-esper/">Mr. Esper</a> recused himself from the final decision because of his son’s work for IBM, one of the early bidders for the contract.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pentagon/">Pentagon</a> made the same argument when it announced Microsoft as the winner last month.</p>
        <p>“All offerors were treated fairly and evaluated consistently with the solicitation’s stated evaluation criteria,” the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pentagon/">Pentagon</a> said.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/amazon/">Amazon</a> last week announced that it intends to file a lawsuit in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. Should the case move forward, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/amazon-web-services/">Amazon</a> has plenty of ammunition to argue that politics and the president’s personal vendetta against the company factored into the final decision.</p>
        <p>Guy Snodgrass, who served as a speechwriter for former Defense Secretary James N. Mattis, says in a recently released book that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Mr. Trump</a> told the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pentagon/">Pentagon</a> in the summer of 2018 to “screw <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/amazon-web-services/">Amazon</a>” out of the contract.</p>
        <p>The book says Mr. Mattis dismissed the idea as improper and effectively ignored the order.</p>
        <p>“We’re not going to do that. This will be done by the book, both legally and ethically,” the defense chief said, according to the book “Holding The Line: Inside <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>’s <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pentagon/">Pentagon</a> with Secretary Mattis.”</p>
        <p>Beyond that, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Mr. Trump</a> publicly bashed <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/amazon-web-services/">Amazon</a> numerous times over the past few years. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Mr. Trump</a> has frequently taken to Twitter to blast the company for, as he puts it, not paying its fair share of taxes from its online retail businesses. The president also routinely criticizes the “<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/amazon-web-services/">Amazon</a>-Washington Post,” a reference to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeffrey-p-bezos/">Mr. Bezos</a>‘ ownership of the newspaper, whose editorial pages have relentlessly criticized <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Mr. Trump</a>.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Mr. Trump</a> said this summer that he would look into whether <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/defence-department/">Defense Department</a> officials unfairly favored <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/amazon-web-services/">Amazon</a> throughout the JEDI process. Shortly afterward, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mark-t-esper/">Mr. Esper</a> launched an internal review of the contract.</p>
        <p>“I’m getting tremendous complaints about the contract with the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pentagon/">Pentagon</a> and with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/amazon-web-services/">Amazon</a>. They’re saying it wasn’t competitively bid,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Mr. Trump</a> told reporters in the Oval Office in July. “And I will be asking them to look at it very closely to see what’s going on because I have had very few things where there’s been such complaining.”</p>
        <p>In a statement last week announcing its protest, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/amazon-web-services/">Amazon</a> made no secret of its belief that it lost out on the contract because politics.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/amazon-web-services/">Amazon Web Services</a> “is uniquely experienced and qualified to provide the critical technology the U.S. military needs, and remains committed to supporting the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/united-states-department-of-defense/">DoD</a>’s modernization efforts,” the company said. “We also believe it’s critical for our country that the government and its elected leaders administer procurements objectively and in a manner that is free from political influence. Numerous aspects of the JEDI evaluation process contained clear deficiencies, errors, and unmistakable bias — and it’s important that these matters be examined and rectified.”</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, retired military officials say the latest round of legal wrangling may mean significant delays for the cloud contract when it’s desperately needed.</p>
        <p>“The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/united-states-department-of-defense/">DoD</a>’s entrance into enterprise cloud computing is overdue. The JEDI contract will be a trailblazer that will pull the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pentagon/">Pentagon</a> into 21st-century computing,” said retired Army Lt. Gen. Thomas Spoehr, now director of the Center for National Defense at the conservative Heritage Foundation. “It has already been delayed, and further delay frustrates efforts to incorporate this best practice into America’s military.”</p>
