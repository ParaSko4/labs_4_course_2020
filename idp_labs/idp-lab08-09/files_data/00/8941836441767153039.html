      <p>TORONTO (AP) - Frist-time novelist <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ian-williams/">Ian Williams</a> has won Canada’s Scotiabank Giller Prize for his novel “Reproduction.”</p>
      <p>The novel traces the ties that bind a cross-cultural family in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ian-williams/">Williams</a>‘ hometown of Brampton, Ontario.</p>
      <p>The 100,000 Canadian dollar ($76,000) prize honors the best in Canadian fiction. Past winners have included Margaret Atwood, Mordecai Richler and Alice Munro.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ian-williams/">Williams</a> singled out Atwood in his acceptance speech Monday. He says the first book he bought with his own money was an Atwood book.</p>
