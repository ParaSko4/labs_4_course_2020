      <h1>The new games coming to Google Stadia</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/staff-writer" target="_blank">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>Google has announced it is adding 10 more games to the launch line-up of its Stadia cloud gaming service.</p>
      <p>The service was <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/gaming/327173-here-are-the-games-that-will-launch-on-google-stadia.html"><b>originally</b></a> supposed to go live with a total of 12 games on 19 November, but the company has now moved up the availability dates of several titles to bring the total launch library size to 22 games.</p>
      <p>These include Final Fantasy XV, Metro: Exodus, Rage 2, and Wolfenstein: Youngblood.</p>
      <p>Most of the added games were only expected to arrive later in 2019, while Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Breakpoint was originally scheduled for 2020.</p>
      <p>Google Stadia head Phil Harrison attributed the additions to the conclusion of game testing by partner publishers.</p>
      <p>“Yes, we were perhaps a little conservative in our forecast last week and (most importantly) our partners did an awesome job getting last few kinks ironed out and through testing,” Harrison tweeted.</p>
      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>Google Stadia is facing a number of obstacles to its mainstream adoption.</p>
      <p>The company has been criticised by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20964386/google-stadia-pre-launch-editorial-cloud-gaming"><b>various</b></a><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/11/14/google-stadia-sure-is-launching-without-a-whole-lot-of-features-or-games/#255189424da2"><b> gaming</b></a> <a href="https://www.criticalhit.net/technology/reddit-ama-reveals-that-a-lot-of-functionality-will-be-missing-from-stadia-at-launch/"><b>publications</b> </a>for its small library and lack of promised launch features.</p>
      <p>Google also stands to compete against services from several other companies, including Microsoft, Steam and Nvidia.</p>
      <p>The company’s announcement comes days after Microsoft<a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/gaming/327769-microsofts-big-plans-for-xcloud-game-streaming.html"><b> added more than 50 new titles</b></a> to the preview of its own cloud gaming service, xCloud.</p>
