      <p>A house located at Muri Okunola Street, Victoria Island which is being guarded by a lion has been discovered by operatives of the Lagos State Environmental Sanitation and Special Offences (Enforcement) Unit.</p>
      <p>According to a report, the officials have been deployed to the house since Friday after the state government was petitioned by residents on the presence of the wild animal in the house.</p>
      <p>A further report revealed that the animal in question belongs to an Indian national who rented an apartment in the house.</p>
      <p>Mr Yinka Egbeyemi, the head of the task force team, noted that he was ordered by the Commissioner for the Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture to tranquilise the animal on Monday.</p>
      <p>Egbeyemi further stated that the Lion would be subsequently transferred to a zoo.</p>
      <p>He added that the Indian man might be prosecuted and will be made to explain how he brought the cub into the state.</p>
      <p>He said, <i>“The lion was found on No. 229 Muri Okunola Street. Our Black Maria and men have been there since Friday. They will remove the animal on Monday.”</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“The Indian man rented the apartment and lied to the owner of the house that he wanted to be staying there.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“He claimed that the house was under renovation and brought the animal there. The neighbours saw the thing and that was how we got a petition from them.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“We have sent him a letter that he should come and talk to us. So, by tomorrow (Monday), we will like to know how he got the animal.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“He will have to tell us why he is rearing a lion in a city; that is a wild animal and anything can happen. So, he may be prosecuted.”</i>
