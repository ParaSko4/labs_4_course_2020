      <p>They meet in a small classroom in the Washington, D.C. jail—<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/adolescence">teenagers</a> convicted of crimes, locked away from family and friends. For an hour and a half each week, these young men find a space of freedom in the Free Minds Book Club, as they discuss books and write about their lives.</p>
      <p>The first Free Minds Book Club met in 2002. Since then, members have shared their poems and essays with their families and friends. Book Club members returning home from prison have become “Poet Ambassadors,” sharing their poems and stories with young people in their community. Written from the heart, their words express their struggles and hopes. Their writing has touched the hearts of at-risk youth in their community, helping prevent violence and heal troubled lives.</p>
      <p>Last spring I met Book Club facilitator Kelli Taylor, who gave me a copy of their 2015 book of poems and essays, <i>The Untold Story of the Real Me</i>, illustrated with compelling photographs of the young writers. The book’s dedication reads: “We believe in the power of reading and writing to teach, build community, inspire individuals and change lives” (2015, p. ii).</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/neuroscience">Neuroscience</a> research has shown the powerful effect words have on our brains. One practice that is especially powerful in this regard is the technique of consciously recognizing and labeling our emotions (“sad,” “<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anxiety">anxious</a>,” “confused”), which reduces amygdala activation (Lieberman, Eisenberger, Crockett, Pfeiffer, &amp; Way, 2007: Vago &amp; Silbersweig, 2012). Indeed, by giving words to our emotions we move away from limbic reactivity (“the low road”) and activate those parts of the brain that deal with language and meaning: Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas in the left frontal and temporal lobes.</p>
      <p>Psychologist James Pennebaker has found that self-disclosure, either orally or in writing, can help traumatized people express their feelings, discover a deeper sense of meaning, and gain greater perspective on their lives (Pennebaker, 1990; 1997).</p>
      <p>Instead of being imprisoned in their pain and resentment, these young men have embraced the power of the written word to discover greater meaning, build community, and reach out to make a positive difference in their world.</p>
      <p>How can you use the healing power of words in your life?</p>
