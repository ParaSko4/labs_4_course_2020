      <p>Car marketplace AutoTrader has launched its South African Car of the Year awards for 2020.</p>
      <p>A total of 48 vehicles from 21 original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) qualify to be in the running to be named a semi-finalist. The vehicles were all launched in the period from 1 November 2018 up to and including 31 October 2019.</p>
      <p>“We made a number of meaningful changes to the competition last year – including the introduction of an online consumer vote and the inclusion of five categories,” said Rubin van Niekerk, chairman of the South African Guild of Motoring Journalists (SAGMJ).</p>
      <p>“This year, we are happy to introduce a further two categories,” he said. “The seven categories for 2020 are: Family, Leisure, Lifestyle, Premium Car, Premium SUV, Sport, and Urban.”</p>
      <p>The announcement of the semi-finalists takes place on 25 November 2019. Once the semi-finalists have been named, voting for finalists will take place.</p>
      <p>This will be followed by the test days in March 2020, when 27 of South Africa’s top motoring journalists will put the vehicles through their paces.</p>
