      <p>An Indian national residing in the Victoria Island area of Lagos has been accused of guarding his apartment with a lion he smuggled into the country. </p>
      <p>The Lagos State Environmental Sanitation and Special Offences Unit has sent operatives to the apartment located at Muri Okunola Street in Victoria Island, following a petition by residents of the area. </p>
      <p>According to a report by PUNCH, Head of the task force team, Yinka Egbeyemi, said he now has the instruction of the Commissioner for Environment and Ministry of Agriculture to tranquilise the animal.</p>
      <p>He said the lion would be subsequently transferred to a zoo.</p>
      <p>Egbeyemi noted that the Indian might also be prosecuted, as he would have to explain how he brought the carnivore into the state.</p>
      <p>He said, “Our men have been there since Friday. They will remove the animal on Monday.</p>
      <p>“The Indian man rented the apartment and lied to the owner of the house that he wanted to be staying there.</p>
      <p>“He claimed that the house was under renovation and brought the animal there.</p>
      <p>“The neighbours saw the thing and that was how we got a petition from them.</p>
      <p>“We have sent him a letter that he should come and talk to us.</p>
      <p>"We will like to know how he got the animal.</p>
      <p>“He will have to tell us why he is rearing a lion in a city; that is a wild animal and anything can happen. So, he may be prosecuted.”</p>
