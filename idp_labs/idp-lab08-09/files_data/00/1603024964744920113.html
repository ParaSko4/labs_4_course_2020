      <p>Ford has unveiled its first all-electric SUV -  Mustang Mach E.  It has been tipped as the first challenger to Tesla's upcoming Model Y.</p>
      <p>The Mach E is the first electric car to come out of the Ford stable with the formation of Team Edison, Ford's group in Detroit working on the company's electric cars. The name Mach E is symbolic to the Mustang's first generation Mach 1 variant. This could mean that the Mustang will get a full-blown model line in the future.</p>
      <p>In terms of styling, the SUV looks the part of a Mustang, right from the headlights and bonnet to the tail lights in the rear. The running horse badge also gets a place on the Mach E. The lines running the side of the car too mirror those of the Mustang.</p>

      <p>Like all electric cars, the SUV comes loaded with features. The doors don't get conventional handles but a push button and hook. There's no keyhole either, but a keypad on the B pillar. The car is hooked up to your phone and senses your proximity to unlock itself. The keypad is available in case your phone runs out of charge.</p>
      <p>On the inside, a vertical tablet like infotainment system dominates the dash. Most of the car's systems can be controlled using this and it uses the company's new Sync 4 operating system. The instrument cluster, aside from being is rather unconventional. It gets a floating display like you would normally see on a centre console, but it is still placed behind the steering wheel.</p>

      <p>The Mach E will have two variants at launch. Both of these will have a single rear wheel drive motor. One will be a 85 kWh battery pack powering a 258 PS motor while the second will feature a 99 kWh pack powering a 289 PS motor. Both variants will make 416 Nm of torque and range will be 450 km and 595 km respectively.</p>
      <p>There is also going to be an all-wheel-drive Mach E with a 75 kWh battery and 258 PS motor and a 99 kWh battery with a 337 PS motor, both producing 582 Nm of torque.</p>
      <p>In terms of pricing, expect $41,835 for the base variant and going up to $60,000 for the top-spec GT versions. Deliveries are expected to begin in late 2020.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
