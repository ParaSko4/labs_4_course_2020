      <h1>Pew Research: 6-in-11 Americans Want More Deportations of Illegal Aliens</h1>
      <h2>A majority of Americans say they want to see more deportations of illegal aliens and increased security along the United States-Mexico border, a new survey finds.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:32:45+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 00:32</time> by <a rel="author">John Binder</a></address>
      <p>The latest Pew Research Center survey <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/11/12/americans-immigration-policy-priorities-divisions-between-and-within-the-two-parties/">reveals</a> that nearly 70 percent of all Americans believe increased security at the porous U.S.-Mexico border is very or somewhat important — including more than 90 percent of Republican voters.</p>
      <p>Another 54 percent of Americans said more deportations of the nation’s 11 million to 22 million illegal alien population is very or somewhat important. Republican voters by a majority of 83 percent said increasing deportations of illegal aliens is important ahead of the 2020 presidential election.</p>
      <p>The findings come as President Trump’s administration has constructed less than 80 miles thus far of border wall along the southern border, though officials have repeatedly said hundreds of miles of construction is on its way.</p>
      <p>For almost a year, the Trump administration has promised that 500 miles of border wall will have been completed before next year’s election in November.</p>
      <p>Over the last few months, Trump has surged the total number of deportations of illegal aliens by more than 450 percent, as Breitbart News <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/09/trump-surges-deportations-of-illegal-aliens-by-453-percent-in-recent-months/">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>For example, between August and October, federal immigration officials deported more than 2,500 illegal aliens who arrived as a family unit at the southern border and have final orders for removal. Compare these numbers to that of Fiscal Year 2018, when ICE deported 2,711 illegal aliens who arrived as family units at the border for the entire year.</p>
      <p>As Breitbart News has reported, research <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/07/12/study-deporting-illegal-aliens-saves-americans-billions-in-tax-dollars/">finds</a> that deporting the 11 million to 22 million illegal aliens saves American taxpayers billions of dollars, compared to the costs they are forced to pay when illegal aliens are allowed to stay.</p>
      <p>Deporting every illegal alien in the country would amount to a cost savings of about $622 billion over the course of a lifetime. This indicates that deporting illegal aliens is six times less costly than what it costs American taxpayers to currently subsidize the millions of illegal aliens living in the U.S.</p>
