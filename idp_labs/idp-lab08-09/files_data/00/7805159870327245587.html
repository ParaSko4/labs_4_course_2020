      <h1>Android 10-based Magic UI 3.0 update rolls out for the Honor View 20 and Honor 20</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:10:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 00:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/arol-wright/" target="_blank">Arol Wright</a></address>
      <p>Huawei has definitely had better times, but even after being slammed by US sanctions and bans — which have heavily impacted their ability to do global business in general — the company is still doing its best to stay afloat. And this also extends to the Honor sub-brand, which keeps drifting more and more apart from other devices in Huawei’s lineup as they continue treating it as an independently managed entity. Huawei is fighting to get an extension on the grace period for other companies to do limited business with them, which will allow the company to roll out Android updates with GMS to their current lineup of devices.</p>
      <p>The company is now rolling out an Android 10 update for the Honor View 20 and the Honor 20 series. Users of both devices, both in our forums as well as social media platforms like Twitter, have started to confirm that the update is being rolled out over-the-air. This update comes with Honor’s Magic UI 3.0 skin which is little more than a rebrand of Huawei’s <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/emui-10-android-10-rolls-out-huawei-p30-mate-20-europe/">EMUI 10 software</a>, at least for now. Thus, this update comes with all the UI/UX changes and new features that come with EMUI 10 and Android 10, such as a revamped UI similar to Samsung’s One UI, a redesigned Quick Settings panel, a simplified Settings menu, and much, much more.</p>

      <p>The Magic UI 3.0 update is now rolling out to Honor 20, Honor 20 Pro, and Honor View 20 users around the world, and if you want to have a taste of Android 10 in your device, you should go ahead and download the update right now. If it’s not available for your device right now, then you’ll either have to wait for it to become available or try forcing the update to show by changing your region in the HiCare app.</p>
