      <p><b>(TRINIDAD GUARDIAN)</b> —  Homi­cide de­tec­tives strong­ly be­lieve that a dead­ly hit was car­ried out on the life of Ar­lene Black­man, how­ev­er, a mo­tive is yet to be es­tab­lished for her killing.</p>
      <p>Black­man was the 54th woman to be killed for the year so far.</p>
      <p>De­spite be­ing wound­ed by her at­tack­ers, the woman brave­ly alert­ed po­lice of­fi­cers to the crime.</p>
      <p>Ac­cord­ing to a po­lice re­port, at about 7.30 pm Thurs­day Ar­lene Black­man was seat­ed in her red Suzu­ki SUV when a gun­man walked up to the ve­hi­cle and shot her through the front wind­shield.</p>
      <p>Black­man was parked at Gor­don Street Ex­ten­sion, near the Mount Hope Sec­ondary School.</p>
      <p>Black­man, po­lice said was shot in the chest, how­ev­er, she still man­aged to dri­ve her­self to the St Joseph Po­lice Sta­tion and alert­ed the of­fi­cers there.</p>
      <p>Po­lice of­fi­cers rushed to her as­sis­tance and she was tak­en to the Er­ic Williams Med­ical Sci­ences Com­plex where she died while be­ing treat­ed.</p>
      <p>A friend of Black­man who spoke to the Guardian Me­dia on Fri­day but who did not want to dis­close her name, said Black­man’s mur­der came as a “shock.”</p>
      <p>Not want­i­ng to com­ment fur­ther, the friend on­ly de­scribed Black­man as “out­go­ing” and one who was well-loved by all.</p>
      <p>In an un­re­lat­ed mur­der, Shakim Roberts, 23, was shot dead while on the doorsteps to his house at Men­doza Dri­ve, Bel­mont, short­ly af­ter mid­night on Thurs­day.</p>
      <p>Roberts, who was lim­ing with friends, was shot in the head and up­per body.</p>
      <p>A mo­tive is al­so yet to be es­tab­lished for his killing.</p>
