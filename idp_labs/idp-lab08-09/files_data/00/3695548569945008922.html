        <b>Front row starter Maverick Vinales says a lack of grip from the outset meant he "never got a chance to be fast" in MotoGP's Valencia Grand Prix finale on Sunday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Yamaha rider had the strongest race pace throughout practice and was expected to challenge eventual winner Marc Marquez for victory for the third race in succession in Sunday's 27-lap event.</p>
      <p>Instead, he ran in sixth for the entire race and was 8.8 seconds behind Marquez at the chequered flag.</p>
      <p>This was still enough to secure third in the standings ahead of Suzuki's Alex Rins, who was fifth in the race.</p>
      <p>"I didn't have the feeling on the bike," Vinales admitted. "We suffered a lot on the rear tyre, and I never created as much grip as in practice.</p>
      <p>"So I could not be fast during the race, never got the chance to be fast. So I tried to control the race the best [I could] and be behind Rins, which was the main target.</p>
      <p>"[Third in the standings] for sure means a lot because it equals our best here in Yamaha, and then to be inside the top three [in the championship] is always important.</p>
      <p>"So to achieve a top three with five [DNFs], not many good races, is great. For me, it was a present."</p>
      <p>Team-mate Valentino Rossi also endured a low-key final race of 2019 as he finished 22.9s from the win in eighth.</p>

      <p>Battling with Yamaha's typical issue of a lack of traction and poor tyre conservation, Rossi believes the colder temperatures made these problems "normal" - but was still confused as he was faster in the cooler morning warm-up on Sunday.</p>
      <p>"The conditions were very, very much on the limit to have a motorcycle race because it was worse than Saturday," Rossi replied when asked if the track conditions caused his problems.</p>
      <p>"The other question mark for us is that in FP4 I did 20 laps in a row with the same bike and same tyres [as I had in the race], but I was a lot faster and I felt... not the pace to win the race, but comfortable on 1m31s.</p>
      <p>"What we don't understand is that this morning we used the same rear tyre and this morning it was five degrees less than the race, but in the morning I was faster."</p>
