      <p><i>Leaky roof in several platforms leaves passengers with no shelter after a downpour</i> <br/><br/>If you are boarding a train or alighting from it at the KR Puram Railway Station, you may want to carry an umbrella with you. Passengers have complained about water leaking from the roof of the platforms every time it rains. <br/><br/>While Yeshwantpur Railway Station is the origin point for trains departing to Chennai, Mumbai, Kerala and other parts of the country, several of them also pass by the KR Puram Railway Station. <br/><br/>A shopkeeper who runs a tea stall in one of the platforms said that the roof has been leaking for close to two years. <br/><br/>“The Railways fixed it, but it is still leaking. The roof on platform numbers 2 and 3 are the worst ones since they leak the most,” he says.</p>

      <p>When it rains, the benches on the platforms also get wet, leaving passengers with no place to sit on</p>
      <p>Passengers said that when it rains, they are forced to wait for over 30 minutes for the next train without proper shelter on the platform. <br/><br/>Nino PL, a passenger recalled the terrible experience she had when she visited the station recently. <br/><br/>It had started raining heavily and she noticed that the roof was leaking almost throughout the platform, leaving all the benches on it and the floor completely drenched. <br/><br/>“There was a huge crowd in the station and some people were struggling to protect themselves by forming clusters in the limited space that was dry. <br/><br/>There were families trying to protect their children, including infants, from the rain. Senior citizens and pregnant women had a hard time as they were not able to find any space to sit,” she said.</p>
      <p>There is only one waiting lounge in the station on platform number 1. If we have a lounge in every platform, it will be helpful. We can protect ourselves from the leaking roof.</p>
      <p>–Ramesh, passenger<br/><br/><br/>Suresh, who travels every day from Kolar to the city for work, said that when it rains he has to use his umbrella and wait for the next train on the platform as all the benches become wet. <br/><br/>Passengers have complained about the lack of waiting lounges on all the platforms. <br/><br/>Ramesh, another passenger, said, “There is only one waiting lounge in the station on platform number 1. If we have a lounge in every platform, it will be helpful. We can protect ourselves from the leaking roof. It is difficult to travel with luggage as it gets wet”. <br/><br/>A railway official at the station, who did not wish to be quoted said, that repair work is going on. <br/><br/>“The workers are trying to fix the leak. KR Puram Railway Station is a major railway station and we have a footfall of over 1 lakh passengers per day. We are also planning on providing lift facilities for passengers,” said the official.</p>
