      <h1>Stay In London And Make An Obligatory Escape To Fairy Hampshire</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Cécilia Pelloux</a></address>
      <p>Where to Stay? <a href="https://www.oetkercollection.com/hotels/the-lanesborough/">The Lanesborough</a>. The 5 star luxury hotel is located in prestigious Knightsbridge, at the doorstep of Hyde Park; with its panoramic views from the suites over the park, it is so peaceful. Perfectly located, the hotel has been considered as one of the world’s most luxurious hotels and curious as I am, I wanted to find out why. The grand mansion was the former home of Viscount Lanesborough and remains today one of London’s most revered Regency landmarks. The Lanesborough is part of Oetker Collection -well known to offer unique experiences-which include nine of the finest and  most inspiring hotels around the world as iconic Eden Roc in Cap d’Antibes and Eden Rock in St Barths. In 2015, The Lanesborough was transformed by a complete 18 month renovation by interior designer bureau Alberto Pinto and architect Reardon Smith. The Lanesborough is the latest project of Alberto Pinto before he passed away at the end of 2012. </p>

      <p>From Lanesborough your private driver -in the So chic Range Rover- will take you right to the station platform. Board one of  the British railway trains  from Waterloo station for an hour ride in the British countryside. Hampshire embodies sweetness in life so well transcribed by writer Jane Austen-one of the most widely read classic authors. Hampshire is so calm, green in summer, brown colored in the  Fall, cozy by a fireplace in winter and so flowery in Spring. In the heart of an idyllic leafy 4000 acre site, <a href="https://www.oetkercollection.com/estates-villas/masterpiece-estates/the-estates/farleigh-wallop/">Farleigh Wallop</a>, an impressive and ancestral estate. Now part of one of the nine Oetcker Collection’s masterpieces, this private mansion has been in the hands of the same family since the 15th century. The Wallop family. A long line of descent with three titles: the Earl of Portsmouth, Viscount Lymington and Baron Wallop. A rich thousand year history that makes this place so fascinating.</p>

      <p>What to expect? You will feel at home in this 11 bedroom extraordinary house shaped by wars, toil, treason and service and by the rise and fall of kings. The decor is cozy and the atmosphere is rich in family’s historical  coats of arms, photographs, old books and various objects. Outside, the British 25 acre garden is so magnificent. Enjoy plenty of walks along an avenue of trees down to an iron gate which opens onto a boating lake and admire what a careful work has been made in the gardens. Carved stone fountain, rosery, orangery and a kitchen garden where much of what is grown ends up in the plates. What can you  do in Farlegh Wallop? Visit the region, hunt, shoot, fish, play cricket or just do nothing and live like a Lord. What  a memorable bespoke experience it is to be immersed for a while in the British chic aristocracy life. Oh lord!</p>
