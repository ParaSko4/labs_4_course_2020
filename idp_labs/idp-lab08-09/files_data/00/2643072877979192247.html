      <h1>Final Bayelsa Election Results For All LGAs Declared By INEC</h1>

      <p>The final Bayelsa Election results for all Local Government Areas (LGAs) where the governorship election took place have emerged.</p>
      <p>Naija News had reported earlier that the National Electoral Commission (INEC), declared David Lyon of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Nigeria’s ruling party, as the winner of the Bayelsa Governorship Election.</p>
      <p>Lyon was declared the winner of the Bayelsa election by INEC Returning Officer and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Benin, Professor Faraday Orunmuwese, on Monday morning, November 18.</p>
      <p>This online news platform understands that Professor Orunmuwese returned the APC candidate as the winner of the keenly contested Bayelsa election after scoring the highest number of votes in the poll.</p>
      <p>Lyon scored a total of 352,552 votes to defeat his closest rival and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Nigeria’s main opposition party, Duoye Diri, who polled 143,172 votes.</p>
      <p>This means Lyon won the Bayelsa Election with a difference of over 180,000 votes.</p>
      <p>Lyon won in Brass, Ekeremor, Nembe, Ogbia, Southern Ijaw, and Yenagoa LGAs while his PDP rival Diri won in Kolokuma/Opokuma and Sagbama LGAs.</p>
