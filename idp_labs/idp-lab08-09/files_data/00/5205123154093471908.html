      <p>The girl was left in a critical condition following the shocking attack on a house in Co Fermanagh.</p>
      <p>According to police, a number of men armed with machetes broke into a property on Trasna Way in Lisnaskea last Saturday night, November 16, at around 9:15pm.</p>
      <p>A 41-year-old woman, who has been named as Elizabeth Joyce, was stabbed in the attack along with the young girl.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the <i><b>BBC</b></i> in the wake of the terrifying attack, Ms Joyce singled out the teen for bravely throwing herself over Elizabeth’s baby grandson to protect him from the gang.</p>
      <p>Ms Joyce said: “The baby was unharmed because his auntie is a hero. She’s 13 and threw her whole self over that baby, and she saved his life. She is a hero.”</p>
      <p>The young teen remains in a critical but stable condition.</p>
      <p>No arrests have yet been made but the police are treating the incident as attempted murder.</p>
      <p>Ms Joyce described the attack in terrifying detail to <i><b>ITV</b></i>: "They burst through the house, one attacker came to me attacking. I was screaming and kicking and fighting back.</p>
      <p>“The other attacker went for the wee fella, but his auntie, who is in hospital in a very critical condition, she threw herself on top of the baby to save the baby's life."</p>
      <p>The PSNI are now appealing for anyone with information to come forward.</p>
      <p>PSNI Detective Sergeant Keith Monaghan said: “This must have been a terrifying ordeal for those involved and we are determined to find the men responsible.</p>
      <p>“We have several lines of enquiry which we are progressing at this time, but I would ask anyone with information or who noticed any suspicious activity in the area to contact detectives in Enniskillen and pass that information on.”</p>
      <p>According to reports, the family involved belongs to the Travelling community.</p>
      <p>There is some media speculation that the attack could be connected to a long-running dispute.</p>
