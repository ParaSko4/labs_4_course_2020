      <p><b>(NEW YORK POST)</b> —  A Kentucky school principal who once banned books with “homosexual content” from classrooms has been indicted on child porn charges.</p>
      <p>Phillip Todd Wilson, 54, became infamous in 2009 when he banned LGBTQ-themed books, as well as others he deemed “soft pornography,” calling them “inappropriate” for students, according to the Louisville Courier Journal.</p>
      <p>Wilson has now been charged with 11 counts of possession of matter portraying a sexual performance by a minor and six counts of promoting a sexual performance by a minor, according to the Winchester Sun.</p>
      <p>He was arrested in August and indicted last Thursday, according to reports, which noted he was also fired as head of Clark County Area Technology Center in Winchester.</p>
      <p>“You can’t make this s**t up,” author Jo Knowles — whose “Lessons from a Dead Girl” was one of the books Wilson banned — wrote on Facebook when the principal was arrested.</p>
      <p>Laurie Halse Anderson, whose “Twisted” also was among the targeted books, highlighted the irony as well.</p>
      <p>“Books that help kids examine the violence, abuse and shame they’ve endured are very threatening to the people who commit those acts of violence, abuse, and shaming,” she tweeted.</p>
      <p>Other books on his list had included Chris Crutcher’s “Deadline” and “Unwind” by Neal Shusterman.</p>
      <p>Wilson posted a $25,000 bond after his arrest, according to the Lexington Herald-Leader. A lawyer for him was not listed.</p>
