      <p>Swedish owned Ngonyezi Projects has entered into a non-consumptive water use agreement with Zimbabwe National Water Authority, which will see the installation of a 2,000 MWh Pumped Storage Hydro (PSH) and 300 MW solar PV plant.</p>
      <p>The location of the installation is Osborne Dam on the Odzi river in Manicaland Province.</p>
      <p>Storage is an essential part of a renewable energy strategy and it is recommended that 30 per cent of the installed solar PV should be supported by storage, says Tomas Persson, initiator of the project.</p>
      <p>Ngonyezi Projects notes that in Zimbabwe there is average 8.5h peak price per day.</p>
      <p>In terms of the design, it is anticipated that the 300 MW solar PV project will require 500ha of dam surface for solar panels.</p>
      <p>The dam water will cool the panels, providing higher efficiency and the panels covering the surface water will reduce algae growth and evaporation by 20 million m3/y .</p>
      <p>PSH currently dominates total installed storage power capacity, with 96 per cent of the total of 176 GW installed globally in mid-2017.</p>
      <p>The other electricity storage technologies already in significant use around the world include thermal storage, with 3.3 GW, batteries with 1.9 GW and other mechanical storage with 1.6 GW.</p>
