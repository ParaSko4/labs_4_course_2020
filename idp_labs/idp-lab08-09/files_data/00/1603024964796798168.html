      <p>The rupee pared early morning gains to settle down by 6 paise at 71.84 against the US currency on Monday due to continued forex outflows and gains in the dollar in global markets.

      <p>"Rupee rose in the first half of the session but was weighed down in the latter half following some recovery in the dollar against its major crosses," said Gaurang Somaiyaa, Forex &amp; Bullion Analyst, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Private Ltd.</p>
      <p>Somaiyaa further noted that pound continued to rally after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that all Conservative Party candidates in the upcoming election have pledged to back his Brexit deal.</p>
      <p>"We expect that the momentum could continue on the upside for the next couple of sessions but any escalation on Brexit uncertainty could keep gains capped for the currency," he said.</p>
