      <p>BALTIMORE (AP) - The Baltimore Museum of Art will add only artwork created by women to its permanent collection in 2020.</p>
      <p>Museum director <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/christopher-bedford/">Christopher Bedford</a> announced the policy Thursday, saying something radical must be done to rectify centuries of imbalance. The Maryland museum acquired its first work by a female artist in 1916, two years after it was founded and three years before women gained the right to vote in the U.S. Today, only 4% of the 95,000 pieces in its permanent collection were created by women.</p>

        <p>News outlets report each of the museum’s exhibits will be strongly tied to women. Nineteen will showcase art solely by women, including at least one transgender artist. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/christopher-bedford/">Bedford</a> says the museum is working to “correct our own canon” and address historical blind spots.</p>
