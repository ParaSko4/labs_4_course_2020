      <h1>Nigerian Students Reacts As University Prepares For Witchcraft Conference</h1>

      <p>The proposed upcoming conference on witchcraft in the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN), Enugu state, has been rejected by the university’s student.</p>
      <p>Recall Naija News reported that the witchcraft Conference had been scheduled to hold between November 26 and November 27.</p>
      <p>The conference is being organised by the B.I.C Ijomah Centre for Policy and Research in UNN.</p>
      <p>However, members of the university community, including students and staff, who are opposed to the programme, have already started staging protests against it.</p>
      <p>Some have started circulating posters calling for the cancellation of the protest while others are campaigning against it online.</p>
      <p>Aside social media campaigns, some persons have put together special prayers to “fire back” at what they described as “the work of the agents of darkness.”</p>
      <p>Some of the posters littering around the school have inscriptions such as: “<i>UNN belongs to Jesus”; “Witches and Wizard, No vacancy!” “Say no to the meeting of Witches and Wizard’, “We are a Christian community”; “Don’t pollute our environment”; “We plead the blood of Jesus over UNN, hence we reject all forms of witchcraft overtly or covertly”.</i></p>
