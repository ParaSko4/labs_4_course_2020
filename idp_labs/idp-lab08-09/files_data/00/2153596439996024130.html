        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>These duties could be writing up reports, managing databases, creating and delivering presentations, communicating via email and other messaging platforms, or video conferencing – tasks which can be made unnecessarily difficult with mediocre technology.</p>
      <p>It is therefore important to choose a partner that understands your need for a solution that will meet all your unique requirements.</p>
      <p>Few brands in the industry are as recognisable and reputable for this purpose as HP.</p>
      <p>With the business-focussed Elitebook laptop range, HP brings powerful and refined hardware to your company’s inventory.</p>
      <h3>Sleek and solid design</h3>
      <p>The HP EliteBook x360 is a prime example of this hardware. It features a thin, light-weight aluminium chassis of excellent build quality.</p>
      <p>The body is durably designed, and the full HD, anti-glare touchscreen can also be folded flat all the way to the back of the laptop to be used as a tablet.</p>
      <h3>World-class security</h3>
      <p>Keeping the information of your employees, customers, and enterprise operations confidential is of utmost importance, as the rise of cyber security attacks cannot be taken lightly.</p>
      <p>HP Elitebooks provide a hardware-based suite of security solutions that reinforce your PCs to resist the most serious attackers.</p>
      <p>Integrated security features include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>HP Multi-Factor Authenticate </b>– Fortifying your system with up to three authentication factors, enforced by Intel Authenticate Technology.</li>
        <li><b>HP Sure Start </b>– Instantly protects against hidden attacks that the antivirus can’t reach by using hardware enforced self-healing protection that automatically recovers the BIOS.<b> </b></li>
        <li><b>HP Sure Click </b>– Isolates browser-borne and document-infected malware in their own virtual containers to stop them from spreading to other parts of your PC.</li>
        <li><b>HP Sure View</b> – Gives you an optional integrated privacy screen that prevents shoulder-surfing visual hackers from viewing your screen.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These and more features make HP Elitebooks the world’s most secure and manageable PCs.</p>
      <h3>Long-lasting power</h3>
      <p>High mobility is key in an era where employees must often work remotely.</p>
      <p>With a battery life of up to 15 and a half hours, your employees won’t need to worry about finding the nearest wall plug with their Elitebooks.</p>
      <p>And if the battery life does run out after hours of heavy use, HP’s Fast Charge will have your laptop at full capacity in no time.</p>
      <h3>Get the best HP solution for your business</h3>
