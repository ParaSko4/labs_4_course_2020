      <p>ACP Dr Benjamin Agordzo, who is facing a charge of treason, has been denied bail by an Accra High Court.</p>
      <p>ACP Agordzo was remanded into police custody by the Kaneshie Magistrate court and has been kept at the ministries police station since.</p>
      <p>But the Criminal Division of the Accra High Court refused the application for bail by embattled police officer.</p>
      <p>The court presided over by Justice George Boadi said the application for bail is pre-mature since investigations are on going.</p>
      <p>The court said because the ACP Agordzo is a Senior Police Officer and two steps away from becoming an IGP he would interfere with the investigation.</p>
      <p>ACP Agordzo has been charged of Abetment to Commit Crime; namely, Treason Felony contrary to section 20(1) and 182 (b) of the Criminal and Other Offences Act 1960 (Act 29) were read to him.</p>
      <p>The court also ordered Dr Agordzo to desist from granting media interviews henceforth.</p>
      <p>After the court hearing Tuesday, the suspect told the media he is innocent of the charges against him.</p>
      <p>“I have not committed any crime. I’ve done nothing wrong. The President called upon us to be citizens. So when I express my opinion on a WhatsApp platform, unrelated to any alleged coup, nobody should bog me down.</p>
      <p>“And I will stand for this. I will stand for this to the end. They cannot break me down at all. And I’m as strong as anything. Thank you very much for your support”.</p>
