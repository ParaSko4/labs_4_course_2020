      <p>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A state audit is calling on New York to do better at notifying parents of abuse and neglect at group homes serving people with developmental disabilities.</p>
      <p>State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli’s audit, released Monday, also says the state Office for People with Developmental Disabilities doesn’t always provide families and guardians with records they requested about substantiated abuse and neglect.</p>
      <p>The agency generally agreed with the findings but questioned the deadlines the state auditors used.</p>
      <p>They previously said the state Office of Mental Health was also failing to comply fully with a 2007 state law that ensures families and guardians are notified and can access records about abuse and neglect at state-licensed agencies.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>That agency disagreed, saying it must provide reports only if a legal guardian makes a request.</p>
