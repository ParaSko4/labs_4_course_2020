      <p>SCOREBOARD</p>
      <p>Monday, Nov. 18</p>
      <p>Kansas City vs Los Angeles Chargers, 8:15 p.m. Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs (6-4) and Philip Rivers and the Chargers (4-6) meet at Mexico City’s Azteca Stadium. The playing surface was a story line last year in the Chiefs’ game against the Rams when it was deemed unplayable and relocated to Los Angeles because of rain and the stadium having hosted concerts less than a month before the game. Both teams have received favorable reports on the field this year. The Chiefs have won nine of the past 10 meetings.</p>

        <hr/>
        <p>RUSHING <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/baltimore-ravens/">RAVENS</a></p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/baltimore/">Baltimore</a> rushed for 263 yards in its 41-7 win over <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston/">Houston</a> in Week 11. With 2,038 yards rushing through 10 games, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/baltimore-ravens/">Ravens</a> are the seventh team since 1970 - and first since the 1978 New England Patriots - with at least 2,000 yards in its first 10 games. Quarterback <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lamar-jackson/">Lamar Jackson</a> had 86 yards rushing, giving him at least 60 in seven consecutive games, surpassing Michael Vick (2004) for the longest streak by a QB. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lamar-jackson/">Jackson</a>’s 1,483 yards rushing are the most by a QB in his first two seasons, surpassing Cam Newton (1,447).</p>

        <hr/>
        <p>BIG MAC</p>
        <p>Carolina running back Christian McCaffrey had 191 yards from scrimmage yards (121 receiving, 70 rushing) in the Panthers’ 29-3 loss to Atlanta and caught 11 passes - the seventh game of his career with at least 10. That surpasses the mark set by Larry Centers and LaDainian Tomlinson. McCaffrey has 12 games with at least 50 yards rushing and 50 yards receiving, tied with Herschel Walker for the most in a player’s first three seasons. He also joined O.J. Simpson (1975), Eric Dickerson (1983), Emmitt Smith (1995) and Ahman Green (2003) as the only players with at least 1,500 yards from scrimmage and 14 TDs from scrimmage in a team’s first 10 games.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>AWESOME ADAMS</p>
        <p>Jets safety Jamal Adams became the second defensive back in the past decade with three sacks in a game, accomplishing the feat in New York’s 34-17 win at Washington. He matched Mike Hilton of the Pittsburgh Steelers (2017). With six sacks, Adams set the Jets single-season franchise record for the most by a defensive back. He has five in the past two games, and his 11½ for his career are the most by a Jets defensive back. Adams is the third defensive back to record at least two sacks in consecutive weeks since 1982, when sacks became an official statistic, joining Aaron Beasley (2000) and Carnell Lake (1997). Adams’ five sacks over a two-game span are the most since Lake also had five in ‘97.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>DUAL THREAT</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/buffalo/">Buffalo</a> quarterback Josh Allen had three touchdown passes and ran for another score in the Bills’ 37-20 win over Miami. He has thrown for 13 TDs and run for seven, joining Cam Newton (2011-12) as the only players with at least 10 TD passes and seven TD runs in consecutive seasons. It took Allen just 22 games to get 15 TD runs, the second-fewest by a QB in NFL history behind only Newton’s 18 games.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>NO DOUBTING THOMAS</p>
        <p>New Orleans’ Michael Thomas had eight catches for 114 yards and a touchdown in the Saints’ 34-17 win at Tampa Bay. That gave him 94 receptions this year, the most by a player in his team’s first 10 games in a season - surpassing the 89 by Marvin Harrison in 2002 and Julio Jones in 2015. Thomas also has the most catches (415) by a player in his first four seasons and is the first with at least 90 receptions in each of his first four seasons.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>MINING FOR TALENT</p>
        <p>All four of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-francisco/">San Francisco</a>’s touchdown catches in a 36-26 win over Arizona came from undrafted players. Backup tight end Ross Dwelley had two playing for the injured George Kittle, Kendrick Bourne added one in the fourth quarter and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeff-wilson-jr/">Jeff Wilson Jr.</a> had the game-winner with 31 seconds left. It was just the 10th time since the merger that a team got four TD catches from undrafted players in a single game.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marlon-mack/">Marlon Mack</a> rushed 14 times for 109 yards and a touchdown before leaving with a hand injury in the third quarter of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/indianapolis/">Indianapolis</a>’ 33-13 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars. The Colts also lost rookie cornerback Rock Ya-Sin to an ankle injury in the third quarter. … In <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cincinnati/">Cincinnati</a>’s loss at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/oakland/">Oakland</a>, Bengals wide receiver Auden Tate was carted off the field with a scary-looking neck injury after he was hit from behind by Curtis Riley. The game was delayed for several minutes while Tate was attended to on the field. He flashed a thumbs-up as he was moved off the field. Coach Zac Taylor said Tate could talk and had motion after the game. … In <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-francisco/">San Francisco</a>’s comeback win over Arizona, 49ers defensive end Dee Ford left in the first half with a hamstring injury. … Minnesota strong safety Harrison Smith hurt a hamstring in the fourth quarter against <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/denver/">Denver</a> and didn’t return.</p>
