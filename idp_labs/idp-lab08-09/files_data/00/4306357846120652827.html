      <h3>Manchester United are keeping tabs on Sporting Lisbon winger Matheus Pereira following his loan spell at West Bromwich Albion, according to reports in the British media.</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-utd-eyeing-matheus-pereira-20897155">Daily Mirror</a> is reporting that the Red Devils are keeping a close eye on Pereira following his move to the Premier League from the Portuguese club in the summer.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old has been in good form for the Baggies this season and his performances are said to have caught the eye of Manchester United, who could be interested in landing him.</p>
      <p>The story says that West Brom currently have the option to sign Pereira for a fee of £8.25m but that would not put off other admirers such as Manchester United.</p>
      <p>His good form for West Brom has apparently caught the eye of a number of Premier League clubs, including Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s Manchester United.</p>
      <p>The attacking midfielder has scored an impressive three goals and made six assists in 14 Championship appearances so far this season.</p>
      <p>The same story, meanwhile, also reports that Manchester United are planning a £200m double swoop for Jadon Sancho and Erling Haaland in January.</p>
      <p>Manchester United have struggled to find consistent form in the Premier League so far this season and they have only won four of their opening 12 top flight games.</p>
