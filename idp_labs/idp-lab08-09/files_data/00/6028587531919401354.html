      <h1>Panthers Fall To Falcons, Suddenly Find Season In Jeopardy With Few Answers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Joe Barnathan</a></address>
      <p>Just a few weeks ago, the Panthers looked like one of the feel good stories of the year. After losing Quarterback Cam Newton to injury, back up Kyle Allen was helping to salvage the season, leading the team to four straight victories and a 4-2 record. How quickly things can change in this league. <a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/scott-fowler/article237282439.html">The wheels have seemingly fallen off for Carolina</a>, losing three of their last four games and now sitting at a 5-5 record. Their competition has been steep– they’ve had to face both the 49ers and the Packers in away games. And yet, this week’s defeat at home to the Falcons was inexcusable for a team with playoff aspirations.</p>

      <p>Clearly the Falcons have figured something out. After starting the season 1-7, they have now won back to back games against the Saints and the Panthers. Their performances may have <a href="https://www.espn.com/blog/atlanta-falcons/post/_/id/34823/can-falcons-rebound-from-1-7-start-to-save-dan-quinns-job">helped to save Head Coach Dan Quinn’s job</a> for now. Even then, <a href="https://pantherswire.usatoday.com/2019/11/17/panthers-falcons-takeaways-kyle-allen/">their 29-3 victory over the Panthers</a> was shocking.</p>
      <p>It appears that Kyle Allen may not be the quarterback of the future for the Panthers after all. After struggling to generate offense last week, he was absolutely atrocious on Sunday. Initially praised early this season for not turning the ball over, Allen threw four interceptions against Atlanta, absolutely wrecking the teams chances at any sort of comeback for the Panthers. He now has just three touchdowns and six interceptions in the month of November, raising questions of whether Ron Rivera should stick with Allen while the team still has a small sliver of hope.</p>
      <p>In fact, there is reason to wonder whether the Panthers should look at Colin Kaepernick who held a workout this weekend to show he can still play in the NFL. His close friend and Panthers Safety Eric Reid <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/panthers/2019/11/18/colin-kaepernick-former-teammate-eric-reid-wants-panthers-sign-qb/4227309002/">spoke out this weekend</a>, saying that Kaepernick should in fact get picked up by the team. With Newton out for the season on IR and Allen struggling, there is a decent argument to be made that the Panthers have nothing to lose and plenty to gain.</p>
      <p>While not technically eliminated from the playoffs just yet, they have a razor thin margin for error moving forward. They may need more than a few changes to pull it out and improved quarterback play is one of them. It would be a tall task to assume Kaepernick could learn and operate an NFL offense this late in the season, but if he can make a few simple plays, limit turnovers and lean on MVP candidate Christian McCaffrey, he may give the team a better chance.</p>
      <p>Of course, should the team drop a few more games, it will be time to look towards future seasons. The rate at which McCaffrey is <a href="https://pantherswire.usatoday.com/2019/11/17/panthers-christian-mccaffrey-record-falcons/">being utilized by the team</a> is extreme and should come down a bit if the team is no longer in contention. No reason to risk injury to their franchise star when there is nothing left to play for. Beyond that, the team should turn their eyes to free agency and the draft, where they will need to fix some of their glaring issues on defense and possibly find their next franchise quarterback. It is disappointing after a strong start to suddenly begin switching gears, however this week’s loss to the Falcons has the Panthers’ season in serious peril.</p>
