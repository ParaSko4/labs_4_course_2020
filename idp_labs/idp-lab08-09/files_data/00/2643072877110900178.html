      <p><b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/muhammadu-buhari/"><u>President Muhammadu Buhari</u></a></b>, on Monday, congratulated <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/yahaya-bello/"><u>Governor Yahaya Bello</u></a></b> of Kogi State on his re-election in the November 16 gubernatorial poll in the state.</p>
      <p>In a press statement released by the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, <b>Femi Adeshina</b>, the President described the election and emergence of the <b>All Progressives Congress</b> (APC) candidate as “a race well run and a victory well won.”</p>
      <p>While sympathizing with the families of those who lost loved ones as a result of violence during the election, the President also commended APC supporters for remaining steadfast and resolute even in the face of isolated incidents of violence.</p>
      <p>In his words, “<i>All political actors and stakeholders must take deliberate steps to eschew electoral violence as a peaceful and orderly process is vital to our quest for enduring democracy”</i></p>
      <p>He saluted officials of the <b><a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/18/inec-declares-winner-of-kogi-governorship-election-release-final-results/"><u>Independent National Electoral Commission</u></a></b> (INEC) and security agencies for creditably discharging their responsibilities under difficult conditions.</p>
      <p>President Buhari urged Gov. Bello to use his second term in office to build on the foundations already laid towards improving the lives of the people of Kogi State.</p>
      <p>He also enjoined the governor to imbibe the spirit of magnanimity in victory by extending a hand of partnership to opposition candidates, while urging those dissatisfied with the outcome of the election to seek redress in the courts.</p>
