      <h1>The States Where Vaccination Rates Are Falling [Infographic]</h1>

      <p>A new <a href="https://www.healthtestingcenters.com/research-guides/vaccination-trends/">Health Testing Centers study</a> about vaccination rates found that more than half of U.S. states have experienced a decline over the past decade. The research focused on vaccination rates reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for MMR, DTAP, Varicella, Hepatitis B and Polio among kindergarten kids in all states with the exception of Alaska, Colorado, Hawaii, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina and Wyoming (these states did not report their data to the CDC). The study notes that vaccination rates among kindergartners have fluctuated considerably in recent years and that while annual changes of 1% or less may not seem dramatic, those tiny deviations represent thousands of children who are theoretically susceptible to serious illness. Anti-vaccination sentiment is one of the reasons behind falling vaccination rates and between 2013â€“2014, they fell to 94% among kindergartners - the lowest level since 2009. There are also other reasons, however, and the CDC states that a lack of access to healthcare and low rates of health insurance among low-income families also play a role. Although overall vaccination rates are falling in most states, there are some exceptions and several have made exceptional progress over the past decade. In South Carolina and Iowa, for example, vaccination rates rose 8.5 percentage points between 2009 and 2018. West Virginia and Rhode Island also performed well with 7.7 and 7.4 percentage point increases respectively.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, 27 states are falling short on shots and several experienced an alarming decline between 2009 and 2018. During that period, Georgia and Arkansas saw their vaccination rates decline by more than six percentage points while both Utah and Oklahoma also experienced a decline of more than four percentage points. Three states - Colorado, Kansas and Idaho - now have vaccination rates of less than 90% for measles, mumps and rubella which leaves their populations particularly vulnerable to serious outbreaks of those diseases. The highest coverage was seen in Mississippi (99.4%), Maryland (98.6%) and West Virginia (98.4%).</p>
