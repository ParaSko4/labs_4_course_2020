      <p>Defense counsel for estranged Senior Police Officer, Martin Kpebu, has maintained the innocence of his client, ACP Dr. Benjamin Agordzo, stating that the former who has been accused of his involvement in an alleged coup is “truly harmless.”</p>
      <p>According to Martin Kpebu, ACP Agordzo had no intention of throwing the country in despair adding that his affiliation to the WhatsApp group, ‘Take Action Ghana’, which allegedly has details on the coup, was only on Philanthropic basis.</p>
      <p>Lawyer Martin Kpebu’s comments follow a bail application hearing at an Accra High Court for ACP Agordzor who is facing trial for an abetment of treason felony.</p>
      <p>ACP Agordzo’s name came up after some suspects were arrested for an alleged coup plot to destabilize the country.</p>
      <p>He had however, denied all allegations of the coup insisting that he is being victimized after his appearance in court last week.</p>
      <p>According to Lawyer Kpebu, the interrogations at the BNI bothered on three main issues which he noted, cannot be said to be evidence of the crime.</p>
      <p>These included;</p>
      <p>An advise to the Take Action Ghana (TAG) group on how to organize a lawful demonstration, his donation of 2,000 cedis to support a philanthropic activity of the group at Agbobloshie and his comment about conditions being rife for an Arab spring.</p>
      <p>Presenting his case in court presided by Justice George Boadi, the defense counsel said “The suspect did not mean any harm at all…He is harmless, truly harmless. He only expresses himself through lectures under the auspices of the Police Service. That is not him, he is a gentleman. People have attested to it.”</p>
      <p>“I humbly pray on bended knees to grant us and when they need him he will show up.” Lawyer Kpebu added.</p>
      <p>Senor State Attorney, Hilda Craig on her part chastised ACP Agordzo for his role in whopping the sentiments of Ghanaians instead of working to arrest them.</p>
      <p>She also noted that his high-ranking position in the Ghana Police Service might possibly interfere with ongoing investigations if he is granted bail, an assertion which the judge endorsed.</p>
      <p>The Defense said the arguments are unfounded as the BNI is a separate institution and distinct from the Ghana Police Service.</p>
      <p>In his ruling, Justice George Boadi refused the application on the basis that, Mr. Agordzor committed wrong in his position as senior officer by affiliating with the alleged suspects to begin with.</p>

      <p>In his words, “the (bail) application is premature as investigations are ongoing” adding that ACP Agordzo’s post as a high authority in the police service, might possibly be used to hamper investigations.</p>
