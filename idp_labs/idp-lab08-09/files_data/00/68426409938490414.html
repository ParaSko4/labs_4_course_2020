          <h3>Alaska</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Medical: </b>Legal</li>
            <li><b>Recreational: </b>Legal</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>What’s the size of the market?</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Combined medical and recreational cannabis sales totaled US$31-million in 2018, according to data from CannaRegs, with projections for that figure to increase more than four-fold to US$122-million by the end of 2022.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Who oversees licensing?</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The state Alcohol &amp; Marijuana Control Office handles all licencing of cannabis cultivators, retailers, processors and individual sellers (referred to by state regulations as “marijuana handlers”)</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>What type of licenses are there?</h4>
          <p>There are seven types of cannabis licences in Alaska with several of them being sub-types of a broad “marijuana licence” allowing for cultivation, processing, distributing and selling of cannabis for medical or recreational purposes. Within that main application, businesses can specify whether they are seeking authorization for limited cultivation, full cultivation, extract-only manufacturing, full manufacturing and/or testing.</p>
          <p>Businesses must separately acquire a “marijuana establishment licence” for any retail location they wish to operate, with the per-location licencing fee being US$5,000 and any individuals with a position requiring them to be in direct contact with cannabis (i.e. a grower or a retail clerk) must obtain a “marijuana handler permit” after taking a state-approved course. The state government has a <a href="https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/web/Portals/9/pub/MCB/MarijuanaApplication/MarijuanaFlowChart.pdf">detailed flow chart</a> explaining how the licencing application process works.</p>
          <h4>How many licences have been issued?</h4>
          <p>As of September 2019, Alaska had issued 148 cultivation licences, 70 retail licences (marijuana establishments), 14 manufacturing licences and 4 testing licences.</p>
          <p>There is no limit on the number of licenses an individual company can hold.</p>
          <h4>What’s the retail environment?</h4>
          <p>The state passed regulations in 2016 allowing individual municipalities to prohibit cannabis retail in their communities, but thus far none have done so.</p>
          <h4>What’s the tax environment?</h4>
          <p>Starting in 2014, the state levied a flat US$50-per-ounce tax on dried cannabis, collected directly from cultivators when products were transferred to retail locations. As of January 1st, 2019, Alaska’s cannabis taxation regime</p>
          <ul>
            <li>US$50 per ounce of “mature bud/flower”</li>
            <li>US$25 per ounce of “immature/abnormal bud/flower”</li>
            <li>US$15 per ounce of “trim”</li>
            <li>US$1 per cannabis “clone” sold</li>
          </ul>
          <p>No state-level sales taxes are applied to cannabis in Alaska, however, local jurisdictions such as the City of Anchorage, which imposes a five per cent cannabis sales tax that in <a href="http://www.muni.org/Departments/finance/treasury/programtaxes/MarijuanaTax/Documents/Statistical%20reports%20-%20tax%20summaries%2c%20etc/tax-summary-2019.pdf">2019 thus far has generated US$880,000</a> in municipal revenue.</p>
          <h4>What should you know?</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>In March, Alaska’s lieutenant governor signed into law rules that will allow on-site consumption of cannabis at licensed retailers in the state. Those rules formally took effect on April 11th</li>
            <li>According to the Anchorage Daily News, cannabis <a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-marijuana/2018/10/05/alaska-marijuana-tax-revenue-up-again-in-august/">cultivators in the state are lobbying for lower taxes</a> given the falling wholesale price of cannabis</li>
            <li>Anyone with a direct or indirect connection to a cannabis licencee must be an Alaska state resident</li>
          </ul>

            <h4>What’s legal?</h4>

              <li>Medical marijuana</li>

            <h4>What’s the state of the medical market?</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Sales of medical marijuana began in May of 2019. The U.S. National Cannabis Industry Association estimates that the medical market will be worth about US$130-million in 2022.</li>

            </ul>
            <h4>Who oversees licensing?</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>The state Department of Health oversees the licensing of medical patients while the Alcohol and Beverage Control agency licenses dispensaries and cultivators.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>What you need to know</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Five cultivators and 32 dispensaries were approved in 2017, but not all have opened, and the state is <a href="https://grizzle.com/arkansas-marijuana-licenses-delays/">threatening to revoke</a> the licences of operators who have delayed opening.</li>

              <h4>What’s the size of the market?</h4>

                <li>An August 2019 <a href="https://arcviewgroup.com/product/ca2019/">report from Arcview Research and BDS Analytics</a>, put<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-08-14/californias-biggest-legal-marijuana-market"> legal sales in California at approximately US$2.5-billion</a> in 2018.

              </ul>
              <h4>Who oversees licensing?</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>CalCannabis (the California Department of Food and Agriculture): licenses medicinal and adult use cannabis cultivators and runs the state’s seed-to-sale track-and-trace system.</li>
                <li>The Bureau of Cannabis Control (the California Department of Consumer Affairs): licenses cannabis retailers, distributors, testing labs, microbusinesses, and temporary cannabis events.</li>
                <li>Manufactured Cannabis Safety Branch (the California Department of Public Health): licenses manufacturers of edibles for both medical and non-medical use.</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>What type of licenses are there?</h4>
              <p>There are <a href="https://www.co.mendocino.ca.us/bos/meetings/28304/28334/28514/28551/LicenseTypes28551.pdf">12 types of commercial cannabis licenses in California</a>, which include licenses for activities such as cultivation, distribution, retail, testing and manufacturing. Vertical integration is allowed, but not required.</p>
              <p>All companies require both local and state approval to operate commercial cannabis businesses at a given location. Municipal governments can decide whether or not to permit different types of commercial cannabis activity in their jurisdiction, and can determine the number of licenses issued.</p>
              <h4>How many licences have been issued?</h4>
              <p><a href="https://cannabis.ca.gov/check_a_license/">According to the state government’s cannabis portal</a>, the state’s three licensing authorities have issued over 10,000 commercial cannabis licenses. Many or these, however, are only temporary licenses.</p>
              <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-pot-business-permits-delayed-20190614-story.html">According to the Los Angeles Times, as of June 2019 </a>“only 208 growers have obtained regular, annual licenses, while another 1,532 are still operating on provisional permits ... Among cannabis retailers, only 39 have received regular licenses while 2,751 are still operating on provisional or temporary permits.”</p>
              <p>There is no limit on the number of licenses an individual company can hold.</p>
              <h4>What’s the retail environment?</h4>
              <p>It varies across counties and municipalities depending on local rules.</p>
              <h4>What’s the tax environment?</h4>
              <p>California imposes a 15 per cent excise tax on retail purchasers of cannabis and cannabis products. There’s also a cultivation tax imposed on cultivators at a rate of:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>$9.25 per dry-weight ounce of cannabis flowers,</li>
                <li>$2.75 per dry-weight ounce of cannabis leaves</li>
                <li>$1.29 per ounce of fresh cannabis plant</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Certain medical cannabis products are exempt from sales and use tax.</p>
              <p>The state government <a href="https://cannabis.ca.gov/2019/05/23/california-department-of-tax-and-fee-administration-reports-cannabis-tax-revenues-for-first-quarter-of-2019/">collected $116.6 million for in the first quarter of 2019</a>, from excise taxes, cultivation taxes and sales taxes. This does not include tax revenue collected by each jurisdiction.</p>
              <h4>What should you know?</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>As a cultural powerhouse, California will likely be key to developing brands. "It becomes hard to conceive of a truly national consumer brand in cannabis, without having at least some modest success in California,” <a href="https://www.echelonpartners.com/img/pdf/US-Cannabis-Industry-Thematic-12-August-2019.pdf">according to Echelon Wealth Partners analyst Matthew Pallotta.</a></li>
                <li>Despite the state’s massive potential, no company has emerged as a dominant player, <a href="https://www.echelonpartners.com/img/pdf/US-Cannabis-Industry-Thematic-12-August-2019.pdf">wrote Mr. Pallotta in an August 2019 report</a>. “The market has been plagued by frequent regulatory changes, strong municipal pushback, license expiries, and fierce competition across most of the supply chain.”</li>
                <li>The state has a well established black market. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-09-11/california-marijuana-black-market-dwarfs-legal-pot-industry">According to the Los Angeles Times</a>, an audit conducted by United Cannabis Business Association, found that there were approximately 2,835 unlicensed dispensaries and delivery services operating in California.</li>

                <h3>Colorado</h3>
                <h4>What’s legal?</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>Medical</li>
                  <li>Recreational</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>What’s the size of the market?</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>83,984 medical patients, <a href="https://www.mpp.org/issues/medical-marijuana/state-by-state-medical-marijuana-laws/medical-marijuana-patient-numbers/">as of July, 2019.</a></li>
                  <li>In 2018, total legal cannabis sales in Colorado <a href="https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/revenue/colorado-marijuana-sales-reports">were $1.54-billion, slightly up from the previous year.</a></li>
                  <li>The majority of this comes from the adult-use market. In July of 2019, for instance, <a href="https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/revenue/colorado-marijuana-sales-reports">the state recorded</a> $30.39-million in medical sales and $135.9-million in recreational sales.</li>
                  <li>Echelon Wealth Partners <a href="https://www.echelonpartners.com/img/pdf/US-Cannabis-Industry-Thematic-12-August-2019.pdf">predicts a market size of $2-billion by 2024.</a></li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Who oversees licensing?</h4>
                <p>The Marijuana Enforcement Division (Colorado Department of Revenue), regulates and licenses both medical and adult-use cannabis businesses. It has separate rules for <a href="https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/1%20CCR%20212-2%2001012019.pdf">adult-use cannabis, which Colorado refers to as retail cannabis</a>, and <a href="https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/1%20CCR%20212-1%20Correct%20Med%20Rules%20Effective%2001012019.pdf">medical cannabis</a>.</p>
                <p>Municipal governments decide whether or not to permit cannabis businesses in their jurisdiction, and what types of businesses to allow. As of January, 2019, <a href="https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/Local%20Authority%20Status%20List%2001102019%20CURRENT%20VERSION.pdf">108 local authorities allow</a> recreational or medical cannabis businesses in their jurisdiction.</p>
                <h4>What type of licenses are there?</h4>
                <ol>
                  <li><a href="https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/enforcement/med-licensed-facilities">Recreational licences</a>: Cultivation, Manufacturer, Testing facility, Transporter, Retailer, Operator (to provide professional operational services).</li>
                  <li><a href="https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/enforcement/med-licensed-facilities">Medical licences</a>: Medical Marijuana Center, Medical Marijuana Optional Premises Cultivation, Medical Marijuana Infused Product Manufacturer, Medical Marijuana Testing Facility, Medical Marijuana Transporter, Medical Marijuana Operator, Medical Marijuana Research and Development Facility or Cultivation.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>How many licences have been issued?</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li><a href="https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/enforcement/med-licensee-information">Medical</a>: 455 centers; 487 cultivators; 223 infused product manufacturers ; 11 testing facilities; 6 operators; 9 transporters; 1 research and development</li>
                  <li><a href="https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/enforcement/med-licensee-information">Recreational</a>: 574 Stores; 694 Cultivations; 288 Product Manufacturers; 13 Testing Facilities; 8 Operators; 13 Transporters</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>What’s the retail environment?</h4>
                <p>It changes from one municipality to another, depending on whether retail stores are allowed. In cities like Denver, there are dozens of medical and recreational dispensaries.</p>
                <h4>What’s the tax environment?</h4>
                <p>There are several cannabis taxes in Colorado, including:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>2.9 per cent state sales tax on medical marijuana</li>
                  <li>15 per cent state sales tax on adult-use marijuana</li>
                  <li>15 per cent state retail marijuana excise tax</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The state collected $266.52-million from <a href="https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/revenue/colorado-marijuana-tax-data">marijuana taxes, licenses, and fees in 2018.</a></p>
                <h4>What should you know?</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>Colorado recently lifted a prohibition <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2019/05/29/marijuana-industry-colorado-investors/">on outside investment in the state’s cannabis industry</a>, opening up the possibility for publicly traded cannabis firms to invest in the state.</li>
                  <li>Because Colorado is the oldest legal jurisdiction, it has generated some of best data on the social, health and criminal justice impacts of legalizing cannabis. Much of this research was <a href="https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/publicsafety/news/colorado-division-criminal-justice-publishes-report-impacts-marijuana-legalization-colorado">compiled in a report from the state’s Department of Public Safety, published in October 2018.</a></li>
                  <li>Colorado is a fragmented market in terms of brands. According to a March 2019 report from Cowen Inc. and Headset Inc., “dispensary house brands still represent the majority of flower share in CO (65.3%). Indeed, after house brands, the next two largest flower brands in CO, Super Farm and Terrapin, only have a 3.0% and 1.4% share, respectively... The vapor category is less fragmented as the top 3 brands, Craft (10.4%), EvoLab (7.9%) and Colorado Cannabis (9.4%), have a combined ~28% share of the category."</li>

                      <ul>
                        <li>Voters in D.C. overwhelmingly approved the legalization of adult-use cannabis n November, 2014. As the Marijuana Policy Project (MPP) reports, D.C. has been unable to get a proper cannabis industry up and running due mostly to the fact that the federal Congress controls its budget and has blocked the region from taxing and regulating marijuana sales. However, MPP says the House of Representatives has removed a block from its spending legislation in 2019, and says D.C. may finally be able to set its own policies around cannabis. This led to a proliferation of illicit and grey market operators.</li>
                        <li>Up to six dispensaries are allowed and five licences have been issues, according to the National Cannabis Industry Association (NCIA).</li>
                        <li>Ten cultivating licences are allowed, and eight have been issued.</li>
                        <li>The NCIA says 2018 medical sales totalled US$14.4-million, and projects 2022 medical sales at US$37.5-million and recreational sales at US$55.8-million.</li>

Existing dispensaries <a href="https://www.echelonpartners.com/img/pdf/US-Cannabis-Industry-Thematic-12-August-2019.pdf">will be allowed to sell recreational cannabis and current dispensaries license holders</a> will be invited to apply for an additional store location, per dispensary licence held.

                              <li>Because of the priority being given to existing medical cannabis companies during the transition into the legal market, existing MSOs are well positioned in the state. <a href="https://www.echelonpartners.com/img/pdf/US-Cannabis-Industry-Thematic-12-August-2019.pdf">As Echelon Wealth analysts put it,</a> ”licensed medical dispensaries will also be allowed to sell recreational cannabis in existing dispensaries (of which there are 55 locations), and grow/process recreational cannabis in their existing facilities, allowing medical operators to take advantage of their already established retail footprint and cultivation/processing infrastructure.”</li>

                                  <ul>
                                    <li>Voters in Massachusetts approved the legalization of recreational cannabis in November 2016. The <a href="https://mass-cannabis-control.com/">Cannabis Control Commission</a> was created in 2017 to guide and oversee the cannabis industry.</li>
                                  </ul>
                                  <h4>What type of licenses are there?</h4>
                                  <p>The 2017 Act requires <b>five types of licences to be available</b>: retail, manufacturer, cultivator, craft marijuana cultivator cooperative, and independent testing laboratory licenses.</p>
                                  <p>As <a href="https://www.echelonpartners.com/img/pdf/US-Cannabis-Industry-Thematic-12-August-2019.pdf">Echelon notes</a>, the “CCC has overseen the adult-use market since its inception, and inherited control of the medical program in December 2018. Cannabis regulators have not limited the total number of licenses that can be issued in Massachusetts. However, each license holder is capped at three cultivation or processing facilities and three of each type of retail location (adult-use and medical dispensaries), with the ability to co-locate on the same premises.”</p>

                                    <li>There is no tax on medical cannabis.</li>
                                    <li>Recreational pot is subject to an excise of 10.8 per cent, a sales tax of 6.3 per cent, and up to 3 per cent local tax.</li>
                                  </ul>

The state has issued 47 of 50 vertically-integrated licenses.</li>
                                    <li>As Echelon <a href="https://www.echelonpartners.com/img/pdf/US-Cannabis-Industry-Thematic-12-August-2019.pdf">writes</a>, “progress toward expanding access to recreational cannabis in the state has been slow, bogged down by state regulators as well as municipalities that hold significant power in the licensing process.”</li>

The directive came despite vows from the state Republican-led Senate to thwart any legislative progress in 2020. In the meantime, the state’s House of Representatives began in late September a <a href="https://www.house.mn/cannabis/">state-wide public listening tour</a> to gather the public’s thoughts on legalization.</li>

                                              <p>Cannabis stores, however, are not directly allowed on the Las Vegas Strip, and few are within walking distance to The Strip.</p>

                                                  <h4>Who oversees licensing?</h4>
                                                  <ul>
                                                    <li>New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services oversees the medical cannabis program broadly and is responsible for licencing</li>
                                                    <li>New Jersey Department of Agriculture has specific oversight in relation to enforcement of cultivation-related regulations</li>

                                                  <h4>What type of licenses are there?</h4>
                                                  <p>Alternative Treatment Centre (ATC) licences are the only cannabis licences currently available in the state. ATC licences authorize holders to grow, process, manufacture and sell a wide variety of dried cannabis flower and cannabis extract-based products. The state government itself is directly responsible for product testing and thus no licences specifically related to cannabis testing or analysis are available in the state.</p>
                                                  <p>Within the ATC category, applicants can request an endorsement for cultivation, dispensing or vertical integration, which provides simultaneous endorsements for cultivation, manufacturing and dispensing.</p>
                                                  <h4>How many licences have been issued?</h4>
                                                  <p>Six ATC licences have been granted and all holders are currently operational. State law requires them to be geographic distributed such that two locations are in the northern part of the state, two in the central region and two in southern New Jersey. Another six businesses were <a href="https://www.nj.gov/health/news/2018/approved/20181217a.shtml">selected in late 2018</a> to apply for ATC licences, with the same rules for geographic distribution.</p>
                                                  <p>The Department of Health is currently reviewing applications for another 24 ATC licences, with eight allocated for the north, another eight in the central region, seven in the south and one “at large” licence. Once those licences are issued, New Jersey could have as many as 36 locations selling medical cannabis across the state.</p>
                                                  <h4>What’s the retail environment?</h4>
                                                  <p>Only patients registered in the medical cannabis program, or their registered caregiver are allowed to access ATCs, but they also have the option of home delivery. Purchase limits were recently raised from two ounces of dried flower per month to three ounces per month. Patients were previously required to renew their prescriptions every 90 days but that timeline was also recently extended to one year.</p>
                                                  <h4>What’s the tax environment?</h4>
                                                  <p>The state is in the process of phasing out an existing 6.63 per cent sales taxes on medical cannabis sales, with the goal of eliminating it entirely by the end of 2022. However, once the state sales tax is phased out, municipalities that host ATCs will be allowed to levy local sales taxes of up to two per cent on cannabis transactions that occur within their boundaries.</p>
                                                  <h4>What should you know?</h4>
                                                  <ul>
                                                    <li>In late March 2019, Governor Phil Murphy and state legislative leaders agreed on a framework to regulate sales of recreational cannabis in New Jersey. The framework, which would impose a US$42-per-ounce excise tax on recreational cannabis, failed to gain sufficient support in the State Senate and backers now expect the next opportunity for a vote on adult-use legislation will be 2020 at the earliest.</li>

An additional 1 per cent tax could be levied by towns and cities. All cannabis sales would be exempt from Vermont’s 6 per cent sales tax. ... similar proposal in the House, <a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/bill/status/2020/H.196">H.196</a>, proposes higher state and local taxes on cannabis. It would also allow medical cannabis dispensaries to start selling to the general public as early as January 2020.”</li>

MPP says patients may only obtain a 30-day supply of cannabis at a time (definition of 30-day supply TK). It is not clear who will determine the definition of a 30-day supply.</li>
