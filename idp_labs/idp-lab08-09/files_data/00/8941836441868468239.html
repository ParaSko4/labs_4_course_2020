      <p>LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) - The University of Wyoming’s Board of Trustees has approved a new computer science education certificate program that will help Wyoming K-12 teachers become qualified to teach computer science curriculum.</p>
      <p>The Laramie Boomerang reports that the computer science certificate program is planned to become available for the spring 2020 semester on-campus and online.</p>
      <p>It will be collaboratively offered by UW’s College of Engineering and College of Education</p>
      <p>Anne Alexander is associate vice provost for undergraduate education at UW.</p>
      <p>Alexander says the program will be especially relevant now that the Wyoming Legislature has mandated such teaching in K-12 schools.</p>
