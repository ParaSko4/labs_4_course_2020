      <p>“The Old Man and the Seat” shows us the kind of thing Rick gets up to when he isn’t adventuring with Morty, and it’s gloriously petty stuff.  Rick has a new intern, Glootie (voiced by the wonderful Taika Waititi), an alien with a warning sign tattooed on his forehead, one that Rick doesn’t bother to elaborate on; at this point, you’d think he’d know how unfathomably stupid Jerry is and predict the upcoming disaster, but water rights for Earthlings aren’t Rick’s priority right now.  </p>
      <p>As Summer points out, Rick is a “shy pooper,” and has a secret, serene spot in which to empty his bowels, boasting the kind of hallucinogenic scenery any sci-fi-loving stoner would kill to defecate in. </p>
      <p>It’s a joke with a touch of character development; Rick, the unstoppable demigod, the guy who makes the timelord from <i>Doctor Who</i> look like an amateur, is ever-so-slightly ashamed of his bodily functions, a vulnerability that only the bathroom can expose. </p>
      <p>So, when Rick discovers an anomaly in his porcelain paradise, he feels personally attacked, his sacred seat used by another, lesser individual. Hilariously, Rick cycles through extensive records of previous poops to find the odd one out, even reconstructing the sandwich that produced the offensive material.</p>
      <p>From then on, Rick travels the galaxy, on a quest to discover the audacious intruder. Rick lives his life like a maxed-out avatar who has exhausted the depths of their video game, his headquarters packed with precious items, formidable enemies reduced to a mere annoyance (it never gets old watching Rick smoothly disembowel his opponents).    </p>
      <p>After entering and single-handedly winning an interspecies war (victory for team robot, the lizards unfortunate enough to irritate him), Rick finally discovers the source of his torment, Tony, a fellow “shy pooper” who occupies an office cubicle. </p>
      <p>Tony proves to be a pleasant fellow with a chocolatey voice, and being a widower, unafraid of death. Tony’s nonchalant attitude unsettles Rick, and he spares the creature’s life, leaving behind a “fart bomb” as a warning, the Rick Sanchez version of a severed horse head under the sheets.   </p>
      <p>But Tony is tempted back to Rick’s safe space once again, and this time, unsettles Rick with his defiance, informing Rick that neither of them have any control over this particular domain, and even makes an allusion to Rick’s mysterious ex-wife. </p>
      <p>It’s too much for Rick to handle, and he appears to kill Tony, sending him to toilet heaven, but it’s merely another one of Rick’s simulations, and Tony quickly wakes up in a room filled with people Rick doesn’t want to kill, but were dangerously close to emotional intimacy (one of the background pods appears to be occupied by a pregnant woman, which is either an <i>extremely</i> dark joke, or just a character with a round belly).</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Glootie’s Tinder-esque app has sent the population of Earth into a series of hyper-passionate, short-term relationships, the aliens planning to invade and steal Earth’s water during the distraction, Nestlé-style. </p>
      <p>And Jerry, having gotten the planet into this mess, proves largely inept at dealing with the situation, until he manages to gain Glootie’s trust by showing how unlovable he is, the app failing to find Jerry’s “soulmate.” And seeing as Beth was shown to be registered on the app (connected to Ted Danson, not Jerry), it’s another not-so-subtle sign that the two make a horrible couple. </p>
      <p>Thus, Glootie enables annoying, unblockable ads which decimates the app’s user base in seconds (take note, YouTube). The alien’s plan has collapsed, but Morty doesn’t have a kind word to say to his dad, who is admittedly very annoying, but not a bad person. </p>
      <p>It’s another indication that Morty, through partaking in Rick’s daily existential nightmare, is becoming colder, crueler, more Rick-like; we might soon see the dynamic between Rick and Morty shift into something more confrontational. </p>
      <p>Rick, on the other hand, has laid a trap for Tony in his toilet, but is devastated to learn that Tony died while living life to the fullest, skiing down “space Everest.” Rick’s frictional friendship is over before he had the chance to fully reject it, and he returns to his peaceful squatting spot, now occupied by annoying Rick holograms, placed there to push away the only person in the galaxy who wanted to get to know him.</p>
      <p>Rick ends the episode in Don Draper fashion, drowning his sorrows alone, reflecting on how isolated and emotionally disengaged he is, his ridiculous level of success and prosperity unable to fill the gaping hole inside him. </p>
      <p>This story serves as a commentary on relationships, moving from Morty’s increasing emotional isolation from his father, to Summer’s desperation to find someone, anyone to love, and Beth’s helicopter parenting. Jerry, who just loves his family, and wants to be loved back, seems to understand relationships better than any of them.</p>
      <p>The post-credits scene shows Jerry ingesting the chemical Rick uses for his <i>Matrix</i> prison, and it bestows upon Jerry the delirious fantasy of being a water delivery man; clearly, the guy just wants to make people happy, in the most modest way imaginable.</p>
      <p>It’s a hilarious episode, the crass toilet humor hiding a poignant undertone, of broken relationships inside an emotionally damaged family.</p>
      <p>Rick might not be able to connect with his fellow man, but Jerry, in his gentle simplicity, might be the most tragic character in the show. </p>
