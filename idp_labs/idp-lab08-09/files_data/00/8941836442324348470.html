      <p>JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) - Washington University has contributed $250,000 to an effort to place a Medicaid expansion question on Missouri’s November 2020 ballot.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/st-louis-post-dispatch/">St. Louis Post-Dispatch</a> reports that the university contributed the money Friday to the political action committee Missourians for Healthcare. On Nov. 4, Washington University’s chancellor and its medical school dean issued a joint letter endorsing the ballot initiative.</p>
      <p>A university spokeswoman says the $250,000 came from funds within the School of Medicine.</p>
      <p>Under the plan, if placed on the ballot and approved by voters, the public health insurance program would be available to those earning up to $18,000 per year. Missouri is among 14 states that have not expanded Medicaid.</p>
      <p>Missourians for Healthcare must collect approximately 172,000 signatures by May to get the question on next November’s ballot.</p>
