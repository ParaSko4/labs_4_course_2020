      <p>Auditor General, Daniel Domelevo, has written a strongly worded letter to the Economic and Organised Crime Office (EOCO) for investigating alleged procurement breaches at the Ghana Audit Service.</p>
      <p>In the letter, addressed to the Acting Executive Director of EOCO, COP Frank Adu-Poku (Rtd), the outspoken Auditor General wants the anti-graft body to immediately stop what he calls the unlawful investigations into allegations that himself and the Ghana Audit Service breached the law when some vehicles were procured in 2018.</p>
      <p>“Your office does not have the jurisdiction to investigate corruption-related offenses which has been defined in Act 959 to include breaches of the Public Procurement Act,” the letter said in part.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Stop the investigation and apologize to me’</b>
      </p>
      <p>He said though he and his staff are ready to submit themselves to investigations, but not to EOCO as it lacks legal authority to continue further investigations into any the alleged procurement breach.</p>
      <p>“I am by this letter asking you and your office to immediately stop the illegal and unlawful investigation of the alleged procurement breach and render an unqualified apology to me and Staff of the Ghana Audit Service within five (5) working days from the date of receiving this letter,” he demanded.</p>
      <p>He said “unless and until” EOCO is able to show clearly where it is deriving its mandate and jurisdiction in the matter is coming from, “any continued or further investigation by your office after the receipt of this letter will be fiercely contested”</p>
