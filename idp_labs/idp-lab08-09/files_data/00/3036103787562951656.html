      <h1>New Spotify special – 3 months for R60</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/bradley-prior" target="_blank">Bradley Prior</a></address>
      <p>Spotify has launched its Spotify Premium holiday offer, which aims to bring former subscribers back to the music streaming service.</p>
      <p>These former subscribers can sign up for three months of Spotify Premium for once-off price of R59.99.</p>
      <p>This is usually the price for a single month of Spotify Premium, which essentially makes the deal a “buy 1 month, get 2 months free” offer.</p>
      <p>“Whether you’re cuddled up by the fire, headed home for the holidays or hosting family and friends, Spotify Premium has you covered with 50 million tracks available on-demand and ad-free, and 500,000 podcast titles,” Spotify said.</p>
      <p>Spotify’s Premium service gives subscribers access to features and improvements not available in the free version of the music streaming platform.</p>
      <p>These include the removal of all adverts, the ability to download songs onto your device, and an unlimited number of skips.</p>
      <p>This deal begins today and runs until 31 December 2019. Users who ended their Premium subscription after 19 October 2019 are not eligible for the deal.</p>
      <p>Spotify also said that anyone who wants to become a Premium user for the first time can sign up to their always-on deal for new subscribers.</p>
      <p>This deal lets these users receive their first three months of access to Spotify Premium for free.</p>
