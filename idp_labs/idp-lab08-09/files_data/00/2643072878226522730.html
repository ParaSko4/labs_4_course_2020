      <p>Governor <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/07/why-there-is-a-need-for-forensic-audit-on-nddc-wike/"><u><b>Nyesom Enzo Wike</b></u></a> of Rivers State has again declared the state a Christian State.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) Holy Ghost Rally, which held at the Adokiye Amiesimaka Stadium on Sunday, the governor said he owes no one any apology.</p>
      <p>He said, <i>“But for God, the enemies would have taken over the state. I thank the Church for standing firm.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“They prayed for God’s will to be done and God’s will was done. But for your prayers, I won’t be here as Rivers State Governor.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Anytime I have the opportunity, I repeat the declaration with authority and I owe nobody an apology. I am standing on solid authority. Rivers is a Christian state.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Speaking further, <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/07/jonathan-wike-others-shun-pdps-bayelsa-mega-rally/"><u><b>Wike</b></u></a> said he was re-elected Governor of Rivers State due to God’s intervention.</p>
      <p>According to him, God dislodged “forces of darkness” who were primed to rob him of his mandate.</p>
      <p><i>“Nigerians are aware of what happened on 9th March 2019. If anyone says he does not believe in God, that event of March 9 should make you believe God,”</i> he added.</p>
