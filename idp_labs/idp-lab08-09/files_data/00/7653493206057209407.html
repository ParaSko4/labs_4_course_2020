      <h1>Huawei In Two-Week Potential Concession Amid Trade Talks</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.channelnews.com.au/author/computer-daily-news/" target="_blank">Computer Daily News</a></address>
      <p>In what appears to be a concession to Chinese demands surrounding the phase-one trade deal, the Trump Administration will allow US companies to continue doing business with China’s Huawei for another two weeks.</p>
      <p>This is despite reports that there are still significant differences between the two economic giants, with Washington balking on tariff reductions and China not committing to import US farm products.</p>
      <p>The extension of around two weeks is far shorter than the prior 90-day extension.</p>
      <p>Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said some rural carriers need the temporary licences, because they are dependent on Huawei for 3G and 4G networks.</p>
