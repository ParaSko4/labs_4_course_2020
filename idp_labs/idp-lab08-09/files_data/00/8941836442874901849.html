      <p>HARRISON, N.J. (AP) - Sky Blue of the National Women’s Soccer League will play their home games next season at Red Bull Arena, home of Major League Soccer’s New Jersey Red Bulls.</p>
      <p>The teams announced the agreement on Monday.</p>
      <p>Sky Blue has played home matches at Yurcak Field, a 5,000-seat stadium on the Rutgers campus in Piscataway, New Jersey, but following the attention generated by the Women’s World Cup they moved two home matches to Red Bull Arena last season, drawing 9,415 for a 1-1 draw against Tacoma’s Reign on Aug. 18 and 8,314 for a 1-1 tie against the Orlando Pride on Sept. 29. That raised Sky Blue’s overall average home attendance to 3,338 from 2,531 in 2018.</p>
      <p>The NWSL averaged 7,373 overall, up 22% from 6,024 in 2018.</p>
      <p>Red Bull Arena is a soccer-specific stadium that seats 25,000 and has a grass surface.</p>
