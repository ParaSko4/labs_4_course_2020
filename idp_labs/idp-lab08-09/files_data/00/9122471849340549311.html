      <h1>Joel Klatt Releases His New Top 10 After Week 12</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:56:01+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 00:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>Week 12 of the 2019 college football season has come and gone, but not before bringing us all plenty of chaos to mull over. Tua Tagovailoa is done for the year with a hip injury, while two more undefeated teams – Minnesota and Baylor – lost their first games of the season.</p>
      <p>Heading into Week 13, FOX Sports college football analyst Joel Klatt has updated his list of the top 10 teams.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, the three remaining undefeated teams take the top spots, but the order may come as a bit of a surprise.</p>
      <p>Here is Joel Klatt’s Top 10 teams in college football for Week 13:</p>
      <p>10. Penn State<br/>9. Minnesota<br/>8. Oklahoma<br/>7. Alabama<br/>6. Utah<br/>5. Georgia<br/>4. Oregon<br/>3. LSU<br/>2. Clemson<br/>1. Ohio State</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Worth noting is that Klatt has Clemson ranked ahead of LSU.</p>
      <p>He also had Alabama ranked behind Pac-12 leaders Oregon and Utah, a fact that the Utah Football Twitter account definitely enjoyed seeing:</p>

      <p>But most of the harshest replies to Klatt’s Top 10 list have come from SEC fans, who did not take kindly to seeing LSU, Georgia and Alabama ranked where they were.</p>

      <p>Klatt’s list is unlikely to be the ranking the College Football Playoff selection committee unveils in Week 13 though. Georgia was ranked No. 4 this past week, and won’t lose that spot after a convincing win over Auburn.</p>
      <p>Do you agree with Joel Klatt’s Top 10?</p>
