        <b>Warren Bobrow=WB: Why cannabis? What other businesses have you owned? Who taught you the finer points of running a small business?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Megan: </b>Most of my professional adult life has been centered on cannabis. In addition to Royal Highness Cannabis Boutique, I am the founder and principal of High Road Design Studio and have spent the past six years building that business. High Road was my foray into business ownership. I think the only way to learn the finer points of running a business is to actually run a business. I have a bachelor’s degree in business with an emphasis in marketing, but I learned the necessary skills of running a successful business from managing High Road Design Studio. Aside from business school and personal experience, I learned a great deal about running a business, in particular running a cannabis retail store, from the clients I have had the pleasure of working with through High Road over the past six years. Seeing them figure this business out and learning from their experiences, their trials and tribulations, has prepared us to open Royal Highness in 2019.</p>
      <p><b>Keyva: </b>Cannabis was always a forbidden plant, but I wanted to know if there really were medicinal effects. Could this plant alleviate pain or restore appetite? After years of research and trial and error, I was able to learn the different benefits and effects of this rebel plant. I got in this industry to pave the way for women just like me, but more than anything I want to inspire others to change lives. My vision for the cannabis space has always been different than most; instead of planning ahead I choose to work backwards and set realistic milestones. Yes, making a profit is everyone’s intended goal, but to make a positive impact on people’s lives is even better.</p>
      <p><b>Kiyah: </b>My sister Keyva came to my house six years ago and pitched a plan to me about how she wanted to get into the cannabis industry and asked if I wanted to join her. Initially, I was taken aback by it. I worked in corporate America and was enrolled in an MBA program and figured I was on track with my career so I shrugged off the idea. Years later she asked, "Are you ready?" Scared and nervous, I put my faith in God and jumped ship. I haven't looked back and couldn’t be happier with my career choice. I'd never run a business, but I've learned a lot from Keyva as well as from reading and drawing on my experience in business school. One thing that can’t be taught is passion and I have a passion to succeed.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WB: Tell me about your company. What is your six-month plan? One year? How has the legalization of cannabis changed the landscape?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Megan:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Royal Highness Cannabis Boutique is a single location recreational and medical dispensary located in Palm Desert, CA. Given our location in a prime tourist destination, as well as a geographic area that has a ton of retirees and a thriving service-based economy, we have positioned our store to serve the needs of everyone in the Coachella Valley, whether they call it home or visit as a vacation destination. Within the first 6-12 months of operation, we will lay the foundation for a long-standing, reputable retail store that carries a variety of products at all price points. We also plan to establish deep relationships with other businesses and organizations within our community, not only to become their dispensary of choice, but to help better the community we operate in through strategic partnerships, marketing ventures, supporting charitable organizations and participation in other events.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WB: What about stigmas? How would you explain cannabis legalization to a politician, say from a state where they are fighting to keep cannabis illegal?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Keyva:</b>
      </p>
      <p>The best way to help others understand cannabis is by direct experience - this may mean letting politicians see how the industry operates with transparency. By operating with the highest industry standards and integrity, we show we are responsible cannabis business owners collectively raising the bar in the industry. Sometimes the plant itself changes opinions. Sooner or later someone close to those politicians may turn to cannabis to alleviate pain or stress and find relief and share their story. There's nothing like direct experience to change minds when it comes to cannabis.</p>
      <p><b>Megan: </b>As a designer by trade, I try to let my work and the businesses that I helped create do the speaking for me. In my experience, I have found that a lot of the stigmas surrounding this industry are based in the misunderstanding of what these businesses offer and what this product can actually provide for society and the people who use it. Design is a fundamental way of helping communicate. That’s the direction we have taken with Royal Highness. We want people to see our store and connect with it, whether they have used cannabis before or not. We want it to feel like any comfortable, professional business, let alone one that is sells a product with a long-standing history of misconceptions. The message the brand communicates is this is a legitimate industry with a standardized, regulated product. The people who run these businesses and use this product are everyday people just like you and me. A great benefit can come from regulating this product as opposed to leaving it under prohibition and criminalizing it.</p>

        <b>WB: Do you cook? Who taught you? Favorite food? Restaurant? Where?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Kiyah: </b>I can cook and I used to cook more, but not lately! My mother can cook extremely well and growing up, I would watch her and take pointers from her recipes. I spend so much of my time in the shop that I don't really have time to cook. Having the shop is like having a new baby I haven't been able to take my eyes off of quite yet. My husband does most of the cooking for our family. My favorite type of food is authentic Italian. I love the breads and pasta with a fine white wine. </p>
      <p><b>Keyva: </b>I do not cook, but my mother is the best cook ever. It’s funny because I always told her I would find a man that knows how to cook, and she told me, “Girl, you need to learn how to cook!” My favorite restaurant is Mastro’s Steakhouse in Palm Desert, Calif.</p>
      <p><b>Megan: </b>I used to cook a lot more before I became a business owner. Now I cook myself breakfast, and we’re lucky if I cook at home three nights a week. That being said, I used to enjoy cooking when I had the time and bandwidth to do so. A close friend of mine in my twenties was a big culinary connoisseur and she taught me most of the tricks I use today. My favorite food is probably any Asian cuisine, as I love plant-based menus, rice and squishy sauciness.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WB: If you could be anywhere in the world, right now, where would that be? Doing what?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Megan: </b>Snorkeling in the Bahamas.</p>
      <p><b>Kiyah: </b>This is a tough question! I love to travel and I love so many countries for different reasons. I recently visited South Africa and wish I could have stayed longer to see more of the 54 countries on the continent. I'd love to return to Asia for its peaceful beauty, but I think if I had to go anywhere now it would be Santorini, Greece. It has been on my bucket list for some time now, for the beauty of the country, but mostly for the people. I love people seeing and experiencing new cultures. </p>
      <p><b>Keyva: </b>I have always wanted to travel to Dubai and visit the historical monuments that define its heritage. While there, I would stay at the Burj Al Arab Jumirah Hotel.</p>
