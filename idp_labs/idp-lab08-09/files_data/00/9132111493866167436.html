      <p>Residents of Manhean in the Ga West Municipality of the Greater Accra Region have vowed to boycott the 2020 general elections over the bad roads in the area.</p>
      <p>According to the residents, numerous demonstrations to get authorities to fix their roads have so far not yielded any positive results.</p>
      <p>“This portion of the road was not mentioned in the budget. I don’t think the authorities have this road in mind. If they don’t fix the road, we won’t vote; No road, no vote! We are bent on this one and we are not going to allow anyone to campaign on our land,“ a resident fumed.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview with Accra-Based Citi FM, the residents threatened another protest which would bring more residents to the streets to press home their demands.</p>
      <p>“Since we have been neglected for far too long, we are planning another demonstration but this time around, no car will move for a week” another resident hinted.</p>
      <p>Residents in different parts of Ghana have for some time now raised concerns over the deplorable nature of roads in their area.</p>
      <p>Ghanaians have resorted to series of demonstration to press home their demands over the deplorable road networks.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Finance Minister, Ken Ofori-Atta declared 2020 as a year of roads with assurances of fixing all bad roads across Ghana.</p>
