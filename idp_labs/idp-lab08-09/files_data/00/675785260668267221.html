      <h2>There was already an awkward moment between sports pundit Ian Wright and reality star Caitlyn Jenner on I'm A Celebrity</h2>

      <p>I'm A Celebrity fans are already predicting that there are fiery rows ahead for Ian Wright and Caitlyn Jenner after noticing a tense moment between the pair.</p>
      <p>This evening, ten brand new celebrities entered the jungle, ready to jump into the terrifying tasks awaiting them.</p>
      <p>However they were quickly divided up as four celebs became power pairs, meaning they got to stay in the luxury camp.</p>
      <p>As a further reward, they got kangaroo to eat for their dinner.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately for sports pundit Ian and reality star Caitlyn, they landed in the other camp where they were put on rations of rice and beans.</p>

      <p>And if that weren't bad enough, Ian burnt the rice after trying to cook it on the gas stove.</p>
      <p>As Caitlyn continued to comment on the rice being burnt, viewers noticed that Ian was becoming increasingly furstrated.</p>

      <p>One tweeted: "Bet you Ian will end up snapping at Caitlyn at some point. #ImACeleb."</p>
      <p>While another commented: "reckon Ian is gonna spark Caitlyn out by day 3 #ImACeleb."</p>
      <p>Even host Dec said that he reckoned Ian would lose his temper in camp.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Extra Camp tonight, Dec said: "Think there could be one or two spikey characters.. Ian [has] got quite a short attention span."</p>
