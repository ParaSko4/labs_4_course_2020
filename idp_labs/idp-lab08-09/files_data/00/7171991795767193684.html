      <h1>This RGB Tree Has Its Roots In A PCB</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hackaday.com/author/dammitcoetzee/" target="_blank">Gerrit Coetzee</a></address>
      <p>[Paczkaexpress]’s RGB tree is a mix of clever building techniques and artistic form that come together into <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/162840-rgb-tree">quite a beautiful sculpture</a>.</p>
      <p>The branches of his tree are made from strands of enameled copper wire capped with an RGB LED and terminated in a female header. The separate wires are all wound and sculpted into the <a href="https://hackaday.com/2013/12/15/ledmas-tree/">form of a tree</a>. The wire is covered in a very thin layer of plastic, which we highly recommend observing under a microscope, that allow it to maintain a uniform and reflective copper color without shorting, adding to the effect.</p>
      <p>The part <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/01/15/twelve-circuit-sculptures-we-cant-stop-looking-at/">we found </a>an especially pleasing mix of form and function was how the “roots” of the tree clicked home in the PCB base. The PCB holds the STM32, power components, and an LED Driver. It doesn’t hide how the magic works, and the tree really does get its nutrients from the soil it’s planted in. This would be a fun kit to build. Very clever and you can see the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=49&amp;v=UbRa6d_wOm8">final effect</a> after the break.</p>
