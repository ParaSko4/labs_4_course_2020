      <p>Developer Grinding Gear Games has seen a lot of success with the great ARPG, Path of Exile and over the weekend at <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/exilecon/livestream">ExileCon</a>, the developer blew fans away with the announcement of Path of Exile 2, which looks awesome from the trailer and gameplay video you can see in this article.</p>

      <p>Path of Exile 2 sounds more like a massive expansion to the original game, as you will still have the seven character classes from the original and your cosmetics will even carry over. However, it takes place 20 years after the ending of the original and features a full new seven-act campaign that players will have to create a new character to play in.</p>

      <p>The launch trailer has, without a doubt, one of the best character selection screens in any game and from the snippets of gameplay in the trailer, it is very clear that Path of Exile 2 will boast a big visual upgrade from the original, especially when it comes to the lighting effects.</p>
      <p>At the time of writing, there is no official release date and developer Grinding Gear Games said that you shouldn’t expect a beta until late 2020. Still, it is something for ARPG fans to look forward to, as the original was much more than a Diablo clone and Path of Exile 2 seems to boast everything we love from the original and much more.</p>
      <p>Check out some details revealed about the sequel below and a 14-minute gameplay preview at the bottom of this article.</p>
      <p>
        <b>One Game, Two Campaigns</b>
      </p>
      <p>“Path of Exile 2 is a new seven-act storyline that is available alongside the original Path of Exile 1 campaign. Both the old and new storyline lead to the same shared Atlas endgame. Path of Exile 2 retains all expansion content that has been created over the last six years and introduces a new skill system, ascendancy classes, engine improvements and more.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>20 Years Have Passed</b>
      </p>
      <p>“Since the death of Kitava, society has been slowly rebuilding. Ambitious men rise to fill the void and their thirst for power is once again corrupting Wraeclast.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>19 New Ascendancy Classes</b>
      </p>
      <p>“Path of Exile 2’s characters are a new set of Exiles who fall into the same class archetypes as those in the original game. As such, they can pick from a set of 19 new Ascendancy Classes that differ from the old ones that are still available in the Path of Exile 1 campaign.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>New Skill Gem System</b>
      </p>
      <p>“Path of Exile 2 introduces the next generation of Path of Exile’s iconic skill system. Support Gems are now socketed directly into Skill Gems, removing many of the frustrations present in the old system while maintaining all the previous depth. It’s now possible to six-link every skill your character uses.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>All-New Equipment</b>
      </p>
      <p>“The entire progression of armour and weapons has been redone from start to finish, alongside entirely new character models and animations. All of your old microtransactions are still compatible.”</p>
      <p>Over the next year, Grinding Gear Games will announcement more about the sequel, including core game systems and the passive skill tree.</p>
