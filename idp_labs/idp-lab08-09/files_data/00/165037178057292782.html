      <h1>With Barca in mind</h1>

        <b>As shown by 'Mundo Deportivo' on their front page, both Fabian Ruiz and Willian have paused their contract renewals with Napoli and Chelsea at the hope of a possible offer from Barcelona... which, at the moment, has not arrived.</b>
      </p>
      <p>These are two names <b>that have been associated with Barcelona in recent weeks</b>. For different reasons, neither of the two came to Barcelona. With the passing of months and the closeness of the new market,<b> rumours are starting to arise.</b></p>
      <p>According to 'Mundo Deportivo', <b>Fabian</b> and<a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/willian-84448/"> Willian</a> have decided to<b> pause any contract renewal talks </b>with their respective teams with the aim of <b>awaiting a possible offer from</b><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/barcelona"> Barcelona.</a></p>
      <p>Althought the club has already shown certain interest on other occasions, the directors have<b> still not made any concrete offer for them</b>. But it is not ruled out.</p>
      <p>Despite the<b> 'overbooking' that Valverde has in midfield, </b>with the arrival of the market, Barca could sell some of the players that they don't rely on as much and to make room for the Spanish midfielder from Napoli.</p>

      <p><b>With good on-the-ball play, capacity to run metres and with pace. </b>He could be the key man in the team's midfield if he eventually went there. However, <b>they will not find it easy to take him away from San Paolo.</b></p>
      <p>After Eden Hazard's exit,<b> Willian</b> has become a very important player for Chelsea, now led by Frank Lampard.<b> Quick and very skilled</b>, the Brazilian was very close to going to Barcelona in the summer.</p>
      <p>In one way or another, to sign these players, or any others,<b> Barca must let some of their own players go first. One of the most likely to leave is Ivan Rakitic</b>, who has noticed a great loss of prominence in this season.</p>
