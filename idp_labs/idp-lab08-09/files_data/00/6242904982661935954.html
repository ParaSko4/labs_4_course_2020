      <p>Black Stars players will depart for their various clubs on Tuesday after doubleheader 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers.</p>
      <p>The team is expected back in Ghana on Monday night after playing their second group game in the qualifiers against Sao Tome and Principe.</p>
      <p>The players will then catch flights for their respective bases in Europe and on the continent on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Of the 23 players invited by Kwesi Appiah, three - Felix Annan, Shafiu Mumuni, Fatawu Mohammed - are local players.</p>
      <p>Torric Jebrin and goalkeeper Razak Abalora are the two players who play outside Ghana but in Africa.  The rest play for clubs in Europe.</p>
      <p>The likes of Thomas Partey, Jordan Ayew, and Andre Ayew, who have been very key for their clubs this season, should start training on Wednesday ahead of this weekend's games.</p>
      <p>Black Stars won their two qualifying games. They beat South Africa 2-0 on Thursday and won 1-0 away at Sao Tome and Principe.</p>
      <p>The two wins put the team in top spot in Group C.</p>
