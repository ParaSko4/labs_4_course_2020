      <p>OBERLIN, Ohio — Operators of a market who won a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against Oberlin College in Ohio after protests erupted against them say one of its co-owners had died.</p>
      <p>The family-owned business says David <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gibson/">Gibson</a> died Saturday. He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer about a year ago. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-gibson/">Gibson</a> was 65.</p>
      <p>His family in June won a $44 million lawsuit against Oberlin College that a judge later cut to $31.5 million.</p>

      <p>Their lawsuit claimed that college officials ruined their business by encouraging protests against <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gibson/">Gibson</a>’s Bakery and branding them as racists after a shoplifting incident involving three black students.</p>
      <p>The students were charged with assaulting David <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gibson/">Gibson</a>’s son and later pleaded guilty to misdemeanors after he caught one of them stealing wine from the store.</p>
