      <p>Andy Seth spent his childhood living in a Los Angeles motel, but that didn’t stop him from becoming a wildly successful entrepreneur with a beautiful family and all the trappings of wealth. Despite having it all, Andy felt some emptiness inside. When he concluded that his old beliefs were standing in the way of the relationships, creativity, and self-realization he wanted, Andy set out to rewire his operating system. In doing so, he discovered newfound levels of creativity, gratitude, and love that made it possible for him to write <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bling-Story-Ditching-Struggle-Living/dp/1544505523"><i>Bling: A Story About Ditching the Struggle and Living in Flow</i></a>. Told as a parable and inspired by Andy’s life, this book is filled with powerful lessons for anyone who’s unsure of how to reach their full potential.</p>
      <p>I recently caught up with Andy to see what inspired him to write the book, his favorite idea he shares in <i>Bling</i>, and how he’s applied that idea in his own life.</p>

        <b>What happened that made you decide to write the book? What was the exact moment when you realized these ideas needed to get out there?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I never planned to write this book. The message came to me in a meditation and when I realized this was a story I needed to share, I spent a week in flow state bringing it to life. I laugh just thinking about it. Not because it’s haha funny, but because when I see the end product, I’m just amazed at what came through me. If you want a modern guide to become the best version of you, this is it. <i>Bling</i> is a parable that teaches a yogic lifestyle through the lens of hip-hop, both cultures I was raised in and continue to be deeply involved with now. Many things bind the hip-hop and yoga world such as compassion for others and the celebration of life. However, each culture has crucial differences that when brought together, can transform humanity.</p>

      <p>You need a tremendous amount of energy to accomplish what you want in life and the first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created, it can only be transferred. If you can’t create energy, then you need to learn how to manage your energy and prevent energy leaks. Most people focus on time management but my experience is that lack of time is usually an excuse. Most people lack energy to get everything done and that is largely because they haven’t stopped unintentional energy leaks. I’ll show you how to fix this.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What’s a story of how you’ve applied this lesson in your own life? What has this lesson done for you?</b>
      </p>
      <p>We all can get bogged down by our past in some way, whether it be from traumatic experiences, painful relationships, or situations out of our control. The thing is, all unresolved conflicts are energy leaks, and when we have big goals to accomplish, we need to preserve and use energy wisely. We cannot afford to be burned out or make the excuse that there isn’t enough time when in reality, we just don’t have the energy. Here’s how I’ve used a burning ritual to deal with unresolved conflict in my life and prevent energy leaks from holding me back.</p>
      <p>First, I identify a small conflict I want to resolve. Starting small is essential to build momentum and help me move to more significant issues. I grab a pen and paper and start writing down whatever is making me pissed. I get all my frustration out for 15 minutes and say it all unadulterated and uninhibited. I cuss and chew people out. I bring the fury.</p>
      <p>Writing down the experience transfers negative energy from my subconscious, through my conscious mind, down my arm, through the pen, and onto the paper. Moving the energy is a release, so I stop being triggered at things that remind me of the issue.</p>
      <p>Now that the paper holds all my negative thoughts, I start a fire and burn it. Hell, I’ll even spit into the fire if I’m really fired up. I don’t want it to exist anymore, so I have to get it out of this universe. Whatever the case, I never keep my letters of fury sitting around. I have a little note pad at my desk, and when I know I’m triggered — boom, I write it down. When I’m ready to burn those suckers, I stuff them into my barbeque chimney, douse it in lighter fluid, drop a match, and watch it go up in flames. I block off 15 minutes every week to sit and purge that conflict.</p>
      <p>I always keep writing until I notice a change in my tone. After going off on someone for a while, I see that my voice and attitude towards the conflict has changed. When I observe this shift, that’s when I know I’m healing. My empathy begins to increase, and I come to a point where I achieve acceptance. That’s when I know the conflict is resolved.</p>
