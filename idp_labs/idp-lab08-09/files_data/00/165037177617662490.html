        <b>Although rumours are reducing, Napoli never forgot about Stanislav Lobotka. According to 'Corriere dello Sport', De Laurentiis' men will go after the Celta midfielder again if Napoli make the last 16 of the Champions League.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Stanislav Lobotka is one of Celta Vigo's most sought after players.</b> Borussia Dortmund, Milan and Valencia were after the Slovakian midfielder, but<b> the club who fought hardest for him initially were</b> <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/napoli/">Napoli</a>. </p>
      <p>The team from Naples tried to get Lobotka last winter. 'La Gazzetta dello Sport' assured then<b> that negotiations were really intense</b>, but that Celta ended up saying no to Napoli's offer. <b>The Italians put five million euros on the table</b> for a loan deal until the end of the season with the option to buy him for 20 million. </p>

      <p>Months later, Napoli were on the charge once again. According to 'Corriere dello Sport', <b>De Laurenttis wants the footballer </b>and if they make the last 16 of the Champions League, they will go after him. Napoli have matches against Liverpool and Genk and are second in the group. <b>They have a four point cushion</b> over Leipzig in third. </p>
      <p><b>Lobotka's buyout clause is 50 million euros</b>, too much for Napoli. As a result, <b>they will have to negotiate once again</b> to try and get the 24 year-old after failing last time out. </p>
