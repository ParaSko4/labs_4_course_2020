      <p>Apple products have a reputation for being beautifully designed, offering powerful performance, and boasting cutting-edge features that easily hold up over time. Because of that, you don’t need to replace Apple products every year. And also because of that, they don’t often go on sale.This deal from Walmart is that much more striking because of that fact. Right now, the previous model of the cellular iPad is available for $299 — which is a hefty $160 off the normal price of $459.</p>
      <p>That means you can get a tablet with an impressive 9.7" screen, powered by an A10 Fusion chip with 64-bit architecture and Embedded M10 coprocessor, for less than two-thirds of what it normally costs. This offers you a chance to experience Apple's legendary creative tools for one of the lowest prices this season. The Apple iPad is worth it for the 1.2MP FaceTime HD Camera and the 8MP iSight Camera. Most tablets don't even have a camera, making the Apple iPad a supreme choice for content creators on the go, who want to leave their laptop (or even their phone) at home!</p>
      <p>You could even leave your wallet if you wanted, as the Apple iPad features Apple Pay, so you can use it like your debit card in most places where you can tap your payments.</p>
      <p>And, this model of the iPad comes with cellular connectivity — so if you need a data connection on the go and don’t want to have to worry about spotty Wi-Fi, it’s got you covered.</p>
      <p>You won't believe how mobile you'll be with an Apple iPad. It'll inspire you to get out of the house and truly explore. And now, thanks to Walmart, you can get a cellular model for only $299.</p>
