      <p>The Motor Traffic and Transport Directorate of the Ghana Police Service has cautioned all motorists in the capital to drive within stipulated speed limits for their own safety.</p>
      <p>This is on the back of the Accra Metropolitan Assembly Road Safety report that revealed that 75% of motorists in the city drive above approved speed limits; a situation which is a recipe for road crashes.</p>
      <p>This propelled the assembly to further launch a mass road safety campaign to create awareness about the adverse effect of indiscipline on our roads.</p>
      <p>But speaking to Citi News, the Greater Accra Commander of the MTTD, Ofosu Ackaah indicated that his outfit would ensure it arrests and prosecutes all offenders.</p>
      <p>“People die especially during the weekends. Most people do not observe the regulations. We are going to ensure and enforce the law to the latter that anyone who breaches the will be sent to court because a lot of people are dying.”</p>
      <p>“To the motor riders too they never observe these signposts because they think that they use a different law in this country regarding traffic. There is only one law for all road users. So motor riders should also abide by the traffic rules and regulations other than that we shall also arrest and prosecute them,” he stated.</p>
      <p>AMA Road Safety Report Last month the Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA) launched its second AMA Road Safety Report in Accra in partnership with Bloomberg Philanthropies Initiative for Global Road Safety (BIGRS).</p>
      <p>According to the report, 75% of vehicles in the city tend to drive above the prescribed speed limit, while motorcycle riders also over speed, a situation which is a major cause of road crashes.</p>
      <p>Findings from the Report which covered the period 2016-2018, revealed that the number of reported road traffic crashes in Accra increased from 1,697 in 2016 to 1,812 in 2018 with serious injuries and deaths also increasing by 89 percent and 51 percent from 2017 to 2018 respectively.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the AMA on Tuesday, November 12, 2019, launched its road safety campaign ahead of this year’s Christmas to ensure an accident-free season.</p>
      <p>Pedestrians arrested for not using footbridges The Motor Traffic and Transport Department (MTTD) at the Madina Police Station had earlier arrested 110 pedestrians who failed to use the Madina-Adentan footbridges.</p>
      <p>Most of those arrested did not use the footbridge located at Zongo junction but instead jaywalked thereby risking their lives and that of other road users.</p>
      <p>The exercise was carried out after a series of appeals by the police for pedestrians to use the recently completed footbridges failed.</p>
      <p>Following several knock-downs in previous years, especially in 2018, and a violent protest, the government immediately mobilized resources and awarded the projects to various contractors.</p>
      <p>However, after the footbridges were completed, there were complaints that the bridges were too long and caused serious inconvenience due to the length.</p>
