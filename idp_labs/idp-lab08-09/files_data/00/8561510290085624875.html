      <h1>Hackers Are Already Selling Stolen Disney+ Accounts</h1>

      <h3>Steal the Show</h3>
      <p>On November 12, Disney launched its new streaming service, Disney+, and <a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/disney-says-disney-plus-has-over-10-million-signups-1203403515/">within 24 hours</a>, more than 10 million people had purchased accounts for $7 per month.</p>
      <p>But a significant number of those legitimate account holders didn’t have access to all their favorite <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/deepfakes-lion-king">Disney content</a> for long. A <i>ZDNet</i> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/thousands-of-hacked-disney-accounts-are-already-for-sale-on-hacking-forums/">investigation</a> found that, within hours of the launch, hackers were already selling thousands of stolen account credentials online — a galling sign of the speed and ubiquity of petty cybercrime.</p>
      <h3>Help Wanted</h3>
      <p><i>ZDNet</i> noticed a significant number of users complaining about their hacked Disney+ accounts on social media.</p>
      <p>Many reported that hackers had logged them out of the service on all of their devices and changed the email address and password associated with the account so that the owner couldn’t regain access.</p>
      <p>Disney’s customer service department apparently wasn’t much help to the affected account holders, either, as <a href="https://twitter.com/Travel4vr/status/1194349581292584960">several</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonbsimpson/status/1196280735096803328">reported</a> being stuck on hold for hours.</p>
      <h3>Robin Hood</h3>
      <p>As for where those hacked accounts turned up, <i>ZDNet</i> found ads boasting “access to thousands of [Disney+] account credentials” on hacking forums.</p>
      <p>Some of the sellers were offering to credentials for as little as $3, while others were literally giving the account details away.</p>
      <p>Puzzlingly, a few of the accounts <i>ZDNet</i> saw for sale were priced upwards of $11, which is more than the monthly cost of a legitimate account — meaning they’d only be cheaper than buying access through Disney if the account holder didn’t notice the theft for at least a month.</p>
