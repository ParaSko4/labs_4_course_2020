      <h3>Moghalu Advocates Electoral Reforms In Nigeria</h3>
      <p>Professor <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/kingsley-moghalu/"><u>Kingsley Moghalu</u></a></b> has reacted to the various happenings during the November 16 elections in Bayelsa and Kogi States.</p>
      <p>The former presidential candidate declared that Nigeria has no democracy going by what transpired during the Kogi and Bayelsa states elections.</p>
      <p>It will be recalled that there were <b><a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/16/video-thugs-snatch-ballot-boxes-shoot-sporadically-in-kogi-state/"><u>reported cases of violence</u></a></b> and ballot snatching during the polls, particularly in Kogi State.</p>
      <p>Moghalu in his reaction via a statement obtained from his Twitter account, advocated for fundamental electoral reforms in the country as a solution to the current electoral problems.</p>
      <p>He listed digital/electronic voting and an overhaul of the Independent National Electoral Commission, (INEC) as what Nigeria needs..</p>
      <p>He said: <i>“With the conduct of “elections” in Kogi and Bayelsa states last weekend it’s clear we don’t have a democracy really. We should stop deceiving ourselves. We need fundamental electoral reform in Nigeria: digital/electronic voting: overhaul of @inecnigeria . Until that happens…..”</i></p>
