      <p>The Nigerian-born Irishwoman, who moved to Ennis, Co Clare when she was four-years-old, also spoke of how the abuse had affected her mental health.</p>
      <p>Zainab took to social media to post photos of the abuse she'd received, which included online users calling her a "n****r" and telling her to "get the f**k out of Celtic lands!"</p>
      <p>On Twitter, she wrote: "For months and months, a YouTube channel constantly compiled videos of me from my account/social/TV etc.</p>

      <p>"After months of reporting the channel - YouTube finally took it down (I’m guessing others featured on that channel complained too).</p>
      <p>"This very summer I had belittling comments said to my face while out on a report - which took a huge toll on my mental health!</p>
      <p>"I’ve been asked a lot and I refuse to talk about what is racist and what isn’t, because guess what? If a marginalized group of people feel hurt by an act/statement...you already have your answer."</p>
      <p>Some of the vile comments aimed in her direction also included one user saying she "looks like a monkey, ape, gorilla."</p>
      <p>Another said: "Consider yourself Irish all you want but you are Nigerian."</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old has however received plenty of support from sympathetic followers, while RTE’s legal affairs correspondent Orla O’Donnell called the racism "shameful" and "shocking."</p>
