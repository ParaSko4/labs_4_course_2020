      <p>Melanie Kennedy, Product Manager, Linksys ANZ said the new product range is in response to Australian SMBs ‘asking for affordable, business-grade cloud-managed Wi-Fi management platforms designed specifically for them’.</p>
      <p>‘Traditionally, their options are either consumer-grade hardware or expensive enterprise solutions that come with unnecessary features and expensive annual hosting fees’.</p>
      <p>In support of the access points, Linksys has also unveiled two brand new Business High Power PoE+ Smart Switches Designed for business-class management, security, speed, and quality of service with easy configuration and management.</p>
      <p>The LGS308MP-AU Smart Switch comes with 8 PoE+ gigabit ethernet ports and an integrated Power Over Ethernet Plus (PoE+) Budget of 130W, while the LGS326MP-AU meanwhile comes with 24 PoE+ gigabit ethernet ports plus 2 SFP/RJ45 combo ports and an integrated Power Over Ethernet Plus (PoE+) Budget of 384W.</p>
      <p>The cloud-enabled access points come pre-installed with the Linksys Cloud Manager (including a 5-year license), which the company says allows for ‘centralised visibility, management and control of a wireless network without the cost and complexity of traditional hardware controllers’ even from remote locations.</p>
