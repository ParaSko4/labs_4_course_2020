      <p>Departing Wallabies Vice-Captain, Samu Kerevi has taken to Instagram to say that he is disappointed that his widely reported comments about representing Fiji in the 2023 Rugby World Cup were taken out of context. </p>
      <p>He made the comment during a charity luncheon in Fiji over the weekend.</p>
      <p>It has been widely reported by overseas and some local media that Kerevi is planning a switch to Fiji for the 2023 Rugby World Cup.</p>
      <p>In an Instagram post today, Kerevi said “Disappointing to be taken out of context, quoted for things I didn't say and when your having a bit of a laugh at a function”. </p>

      <p>Kerevi went on to say that he has loved representing Fiji in his younger days and he is proud of his Fijian heritage but also extremely proud and honored to be a Wallaby and all that Australia has done for his family and him. </p>
      <p>Apart from the statement, Kerevi also posted a viral video that shows Actor Denzel Washington criticizing the "misinformation" by the media.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old's time in the Wallabies jersey is over for now as he heads to Japan to play with Top League side Suntory.</p>
      <p>Kerevi has signed a three-year deal.</p>
      <p>Under Australia’s current eligibility laws, Kerevi will not be able to play Tests during that time but could return to Australia before the 2023 Rugby World Cup, before his 30th birthday. </p>
