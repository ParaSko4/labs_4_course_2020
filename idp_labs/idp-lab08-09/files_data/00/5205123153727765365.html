        <b>PIERS MORGAN revealed that he's "almost exclusively Irish" as he received the award for Outstanding Contribution to Broadcasting and Journalism at the 2019 Irish Post Awards last week.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Speaking on stage with his good friend Eamonn Holmes, the <i>Good Morning Britain</i> presenter addressed the question of just how Irish he was.</p>
      <p>"Well my father was Eamonn Vincent O'Meara and he died when I was just one," Piers explained.</p>
      <p>"He came form Galway and he had a sister who moved to Offaly, and a lot of cousins in Dublin.</p>
      <p>"So I feel very Irish."</p>

      <p>The 54-year-old even admitted that he'd done the DNA test to prove it.</p>
      <p>"I had my DNA test done last year," he said.</p>
      <p>"Zero English and almost exclusively Irish.</p>
      <p>"So whether you like it or not, I am one of you," he laughed.</p>
      <p>He went on to recall a story about when he was living in the US, and a petition was started in order to get him deported, due to his stance on gun-control.</p>
      <p>"There was a petition to have me deported from America and it was signed by 150,000 Americans," he explained.</p>
      <p>"Then there was a rival petition started in England to stop me from coming back.</p>
      <p>"Finally, one guy came up on Twitter, from Cork, who began a petition to bring me to my homeland of Ireland.</p>
      <p>"It didn't go down massively well, I have to say, but I do feel tonight I'm amongst my own. So hopefully, I can come back."</p>

      <p>He went on to admit that he was "very proud" of his Irish origins, and even more so of winning his Irish Post Award.</p>
      <p>"Actually it's very nice. I don't win many awards," he said speaking exclusively to the <i><b>Irish Post</b></i>.</p>
      <p>"Normally they sort of nominate me and then make sure I don't win.</p>
      <p>"Here, there was no nomination process, so I actually get something, it's great."</p>
      <p>On Monday, Morgan brought his award along with him to the set of <i>Good Morning Britain</i>, and confirmed to the nation how much enjoyed the evening.</p>
      <p>"I've got to say, what a great laugh that was!</p>
