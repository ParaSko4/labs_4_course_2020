      <p>It was “no big deal” that former President John Mahama voluntarily weeded the median of the road in front of the military cemetery, Mrs Cecilia Dapaah, Minister of Sanitation has said.</p>
      <p>According to her, it is incumbent upon every good citizen to keep their immediate surroundings clean and also volunteer, if they can, to cleaning public places, therefore, Ghanaians should emulate the good example of Mr Mahama, saying his volunteerism was commendable.</p>
      <p>According to Mrs Dapaah, President Nana Akufo-Addo has asked Ghanaians “to be citizens and not spectators”, and, so, if the former President thinks weeding to keep the environment clean is his way of being a good citizen, then it is a step the right direction, she told Kwabena Biobie Ansah on the Citizens show on Accra100.5FM.</p>
      <p>Subsequent to the volunteerism of Mr Mahama, who is the flag bearer of the main opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC), the party’s National Organiser, Mr Joshua Hamidu Akamba, the National Organiser of the NDC, in a statement on Tuesday, 12 November 2019, urged all the Constituency Organisers to “observe a nationwide weeding and clean-up up exercise on Saturday, 16 November 2019 in all regional and district capitals in honour of the flag bearer of the NDC, H.E. John Dramani Mahama”.</p>
