      <h3>Is Emmanuel Sanders playing Week 11?</h3>
      <p><b>UPDATE 2: </b>Sanders is officially ACTIVE.</p>
      <p><b>UPDATE: </b>Sanders is <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1196039699426660352">expected to be active today</a> against Arizona, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter.</p>
      <p>Despite missing practice all week, Sanders (ribs) said he's "<a href="https://twitter.com/mattbarrows/status/1195461519372214272">going to try</a>" to play Sunday against the Cardinals.</p>
      <p>That likely means a decision will be made after warm-ups. Either way, fantasy owners shouldn't rely on Sanders. Not only does he have a late kickoff, but he also could make an early exit if he can't tolerate the pain. If he's out, Deebo Samuel would go from a boom-or-bust FLEX to legit WR3, and Kendrick Bourne would also be in play as a FLEX.</p>

      <h3>Marquise Brown injury update</h3>
      <p><b>UPDATE 2: </b>Brown is officially ACTIVE.</p>
      <p><b>UPDATE: </b>Brown is <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1195953238278918145">expected to play</a> against the Texans today, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter.</p>
      <p>Brown (ankle) got in limited practices on Wednesday and Friday and is "<a href="https://twitter.com/jamisonhensley/status/1195452265047437313">questionable</a>" for Sunday's game against the Texans.</p>
      <p>Brown seems likely to play after suiting up last week and not suffering any reported setbacks. He makes for an excellent WR2 in a favorable matchup against Houston.</p>

      <h3>Is Gerald Everett playing Sunday night?</h3>
      <p><b>UPDATE: </b>Everett is officially ACTIVE.</p>
      <p>Everett (wrist) practiced in a limited fashion all week, and Rams coach Sean McVaysaid he <a href="https://twitter.com/LindseyThiry/status/1195098455556993025">expects Everett to suit up</a> Sunday night against the Bears.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Chicago hasn't been great against tight ends this year, making Everett a solid play. If he is a surprise scratch, Rams backup Tyler Higbeewould be a decent fill-in.</p>
