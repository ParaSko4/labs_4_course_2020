      <p>Sir, – I thoroughly digested your report on the trials and tribulations of sourcing and preparing food for the delectation of a Supreme Court judge (“<a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/hobnobs-for-bigwig-a-judge-s-strict-dietary-demands-1.4084518">Hobnobs for bigwig: A judge’s strict dietary demands</a>”, News, November 16th).</p>
      <p>However, I was appalled to learn that cream for the coffees is served from a “pouring cow”. I am not one to judge but I would expect a tasteful Royal Doulton jug, at the very least. – Yours, etc,</p>
      <p>FRANK BYRNE,</p>
      <p>Glasnevin ,</p>
      <p>Dublin 9 .</p>
      <p>Sir, – The penchant for strictly English apples, has given me a new understanding of the old saying, “It would give you the pip”. – Yours, etc,</p>
      <p>Dr TONY WALSH,</p>
      <p>Rathmines,</p>
      <p>Dublin 6.</p>
      <p>Sir, – Saturday’s front page featured a banker apologising yet again.</p>
      <p>Is it any wonder the general public feels like the skin on Mr Justice Peter Charleton’s Marks &amp; Spencer mackerel? – Yours, etc,</p>
      <p>DECLAN LEYDON,</p>
      <p>Malahide,</p>
      <p>Co Dublin.</p>
      <p>Sir, – I would have thought a serrated fish knife would be best to skin a mackerel, but who am I to judge? – Yours, etc,</p>
      <p>HUGH McDONNELL,</p>
      <p>Termonfeckin,</p>
      <p>Co Louth.</p>
      <p>Sir, – Is it really newsworthy that a judge likes Hobnobs and English apples? Is this front-page news?</p>
      <p>Peter Charleton was a daily customer in our restaurant when he served on the Morris tribunal. A truly clever, down-to-earth, mannerly and courteous gentleman, with a great sense of humour, he treated all of our team with utter respect and as equals.</p>
      <p>He is a truly gifted judge.</p>
      <p>That his dietary preferences are emblazoned on the front of The Irish Times is a new low for journalism. – Yours, etc,</p>
      <p>BARBARA BERMAN,</p>
      <p>Glenageary,</p>
      <p>Co Dublin.</p>
