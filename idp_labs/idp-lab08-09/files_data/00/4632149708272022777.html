      <h1>Hong Kong cop hit by protester's arrow as fierce clashes rage</h1>

      <p><i>Universities see some of the worst violence in months of protests; school closure extended<br/></i><br/><br/>A police officer was struck by an arrow fired by a Hong Kong protester on Sunday, as fierce clashes raged around a campus which has turned into a base for a pro-democracy movement whose unrelenting protests have plunged the city into turmoil. Scores of activists dug in at Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) vowing to defend it from police and to maintain a blockade on the nearby Cross Harbour Tunnel, which has been closed for several days. As dusk fell, police tried to retake a footbridge over the tunnel but were met by a barrage of petrol bombs. <br/><br/>Earlier, activists parried an attempt by police to break through into the PolyU campus, firing rocks from a homemade catapult from the university roof. Police shared images of an arrow embedded in the calf of an officer outside the campus and decried the use of "lethal weapons," declaring the campus a "riot scene" - a rioting conviction carries up to 10 years in jail. But protesters appeared resolute in their desire to turn the campus into a hub - a twist in tactics by a leaderless movement so far defined by its fluid, unpredictable nature. Activists have vowed to wreak further havoc on Monday, in a follow-up to a week of chaos which left city streets strewn with debris and saw white-collar workers take to the streets in support of the frontline protesters. <br/><br/><br/>Hong Kong Education Bureau announced that classes from kindergarten to high school would be suspended again on Monday because of safety concerns. Classes have been canceled since Thursday, after the bureau came under criticism for not doing so earlier.</p>
