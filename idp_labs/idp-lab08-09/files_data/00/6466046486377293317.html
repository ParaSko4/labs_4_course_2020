      <p>London - Shell Marine, Royal Dutch Shell shipping division, has extended its relationship with China <b>COSCO Shipping Company </b>Limited businesses, after winning a contract to supply lubricants for five 62,000 dwt multi-purpose pulp carriers due delivery to COSCO SHIPPING Specialized Carriers Co Ltd in 2019 and 2020.</p>
      <p>The lubricants contract, won in a <b>competitive negotiation process</b>, calls for delivery of the two-stroke engine cylinder oils Shell Alexia 100 and Shell Alexia 40 and the multi-functional lubricants Shell Melina S30 and Shell Argina S3 40.</p>
      <p><b>Alexia 100 and Alexia 40</b> are part of Shell Marine’s portfolio of cylinder oils protecting two-stroke engines across a full range of vessel operating profiles, machinery specifications and fuel sulphur contents, now and after the introduction of IMO’s global sulphur cap from January 1, 2020.</p>
      <p>“There is a direct relationship between the quality of <b>marine lubricants and engine reliability</b>, and Shell Marine is delighted to have once again secured a major contract with COSCO SHIPPING group,” said Joris van Brussel, Shell Marine Global General Manager. “We look forward to working with COSCO SHIPPING to optimise their vessels’ total cost of ownership and by meeting expectations for deliveries to an extensive list of ports.”</p>
