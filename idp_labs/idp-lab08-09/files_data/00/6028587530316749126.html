      <p><b>Topline</b>: Prince Andrew has defended his decision to take part in an interview about his former friendship with deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein that was described by critics as a “car crash” and condemned by the financier’s alleged victims.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sources close to Queen Elizabeth II’s son told the BBC that the royal conducted his interview with BBC journalist Emily Maitlis with “honesty and humility.” According to <i>The Times</i>, he reportedly told the queen that the interview went “pretty well.”</li>
        <li>But the interview was described as “excruciating” and a “car crash” by the press. On Monday, most newspapers in the U.K. led with the fallout from the program. The <i>Financial Times</i> said the performance was one of the royal family’s most misjudged moves, while the <i>Daily Mail</i> referred to Andrew’s “jaw-dropping insensitivity.” <i>The Guardian</i> led on critics’ calls for Andrew to apologize to the victims.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>During the interview, which Maitlis understood was approved by the queen, Andrew categorically denied that he had sex with then-17-year-old Virginia Roberts, now Giuffre. Giuffre has said that she was forced to have sex with the royal three times.</li>
        <li>Andrew also suggested that a photograph of him standing next to the then-teenage Giuffre could have been doctored, and that he was not with Giuffre on March 10 2001, the night of the alleged meet, as he was taking his daughter to a party at Pizza Express.</li>
        <li>Among heavy criticism of his performance, Andrew was slammed for failing to mention any of the women who say they were exploited by Epstein. </li>
        <li>Andrew has faced months of questions over how much he knew about Epstein’s wrongdoings, and he has previously denied any sexual contact with Giuffre. Since the interview, Giuffre has retweeted a number of critiques of Andrew's interview.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Chief critics</b>: The interview has raised even more questions and scrutiny of the 59-year-old’s friendship with Epstein. Royal biographer Catharine Mayer said the performance was "terrible" because it erased the women who say they were exploited by Epstein and his network, while royal expert Angela Levin said that the interview was a sign of the senior royal’s “arrogance” as Andrew does not listen to his advisors. She added that the Queen would likely be “embarrassed” by the performance, the BBC reported. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, lawyer Gloria Allred, who is representing a number of alleged Epstein victims, called for Andrew to speak voluntarily with the FBI as the charges made against him by Virginia Giuffre are “very, very serious.” Andrew said in the interview that he would testify under oath about his relationship with Giuffre if his lawyers advised him to.</p>
      <p><b>Key background</b>: Giuffre has <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/08/28/jeffrey-epstein-prince-andrew/">previously called</a> on Andrew to “come clean” about her claims. Epstein and Andrew had a well-documented friendship throughout the 1990s and 2000s that appeared to continue even after Epstein was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008. The 66-year-old American was found dead in his prison cell in August as he was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.</p>
      <p>Andrew, who in the interview said he did not regret his friendship with Epstein, has previously come in for criticism over his business ties. He resigned as the U.K.'s envoy for trade in 2011 amid questions over his friendship with Epstein, meetings with Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's son, and for welcoming the son-in-law of Tunisia's ousted president to Buckingham Palace.</p>
