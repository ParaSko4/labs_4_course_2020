      <p><b><i>By Adam Vaughan<br/></i></b><br/>More than a million electric cars were bought globally in the first half of this year, the same number sold across the whole of 2017. This rapid growth is good news for air quality and climate change, but there is a potential sting in the tail. <br/><br/>There is no such thing as an electric vehicle (EV) battery waste mountain... yet. However, the number of EVs set to be sold globally this year could one day lead to more than 500,000 tonnes of battery waste, five times the weight of all portable batteries recycled in the European Union annually. <br/><br/>Those lithium-ion car batteries must be recycled or they will pose an environmental and safety risk, says the research by Laura Driscoll at the University of Birmingham, UK, and her colleagues. "It's a challenge because most current generation batteries aren't designed for recycling," she says. <br/><br/>For example, Tesla's high-end cars use packs of cylindrical battery cells. In some cases these are bonded into a battery module, making them hard to remove and recycle - though the company says it is working to improve this. Nissan's Leaf model, by contrast, uses a pouch of rectangular cells which are easier to open and separate for recycling. There is no standardisation among carmakers on battery packs, and little sign of any coming soon. <br/><br/>"If the battery packs were more of a standard design, it would make the process at end-of-life much easier," says Driscoll. <br/><br/>Most EV batteries should last around 15 to 20 years. While their first decade will probably be in a car, some have already gone on to a second life as solar power storage batteries in homes, and more will follow. Still, eventually they will need to be recycled. Driscoll says it will be "environmentally disastrous" if there isn't a strategy for dealing with the batteries. What's more, stockpiling old batteries poses fire risks. Another concern is batteries being exported to countries like India for a legitimate second use, such as powering a microgrid, but where no recycling facilities exist. <br/><br/>"That could be a growing time bomb, especially if things take off quickly," says Jonathan Radcliffe at the University of Birmingham. <br/><br/><br/>As well as the environmental benefits of mining fewer raw materials, recycling would bring an economic opportunity through reclaiming metals from batteries, says Driscoll. Cobalt, nickel and manganese are three of the most valuable to recover from them. <br/><br/>The success of recycling will depend partly on automation, as robots can do the job cheaper, faster and safer than humans, say Driscoll and her colleagues. Which brings us back to carmakers: if they standardised battery packs or made them machine-readable, that would aid automation. <br/><br/><br/>"[Carmakers] are a bit conflicted because they want a competitive advantage, to make the batteries as cheap and high-performance as they can. That might not always align with making them in a certain set of standards," says Radcliffe. That is why regulation will be key to manufacturers' decisions and, in turn, how easily we can tackle that future battery waste mountain.</p>
