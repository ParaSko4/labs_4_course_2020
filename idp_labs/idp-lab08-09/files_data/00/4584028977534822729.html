      <p>Grenada took a 3-2 win over Belize on Sunday in the final match of Group A of League B in the 2019-20 Concacaf Nations League at the Kirani James Athletic Stadium in St. George’s, Grenada.</p>
      <p>The hosts took the lead in the scoreboard first thanks to a Jamal Charles header in the 14th minute.</p>
      <p>Ian Gaynair responded with a header of his own to level the score for Belize in the 32nd minute.</p>
      <p>The visitors would take the lead with a goal by Michael Salazar in the 55th minute.</p>
      <p>That lead would only last four minutes as Charles completed a brace to draw the score in the 59th minute.</p>
      <p>Charles extended Grenada’s lead to 3-2 in the 68th minute of the match. The hat-trick increased the Grenadian’s total to six goals in CNL play.</p>
      <p>With the win, Grenada finish the group stage with an undefeated 4-2-0 mark. Grenada also gains promotion to League A as the head of the group.</p>
      <p>Belize finish third in the group with the loss and French Guiana’s win earlier in the day. French Guiana finishes second and advances to the first round of 2021 Gold Cup qualifying as a result.</p>
