        <b>Sunday’s 2-0 win over Albania saw France give Didier Deschamps reason to celebrate in his 100th game at the helm of Les Bleus.</b>

      <p>Didier Deschamps paid tribute to his players after taking charge of France for the 100th time in Sunday’s 2-0 win away to Albania.</p>
      <p>France – who were already assured of Euro 2020 qualification – eased to victory in Tirana, with Antoine Griezmann setting up Corentin Tolisso for the opener before then scoring himself.</p>
      <p>Victory ensured Les Bleus finish top of Group H and allowed coach Deschamps to celebrate his milestone at the helm in fitting fashion.</p>
      <p>However, the national team boss shifted focus on to the players when asked about reaching the landmark.</p>
      <p>He told TF1: “I’ve been touched by what people have said about my 100th game.</p>
      <p>“I’m dependent on the players and some of them have been with me from the start of the journey, helping France get very good results along the way.</p>

      <p>“There’s personal pride, but most of all I’m proud of my players and their spirit.”</p>
      <p>Tolisso’s opener was the Bayern Munich midfielder’s first international goal and he put it down to a pre-match pep talk with himself.</p>
      <p>“I’m very proud to have scored my first international goal and very happy,” Tolisso said.</p>
      <p>“I said to myself before the game that I needed to make a run from a free-kick and that if the ball was going to come to me then so be it.</p>
      <p>“I made the run and the ball came to me and it paid off.”</p>
