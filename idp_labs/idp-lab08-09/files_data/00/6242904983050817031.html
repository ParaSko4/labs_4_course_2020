        <b>THE TEAM NEWS</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>SAO TOME &amp; PRINCIPE</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sao Tome &amp; Principe have never qualified for the AFCON finals and opened their 2021 qualifying group stage campaign with a comprehensive 4-0 defeat away from home against Sudan.</li>
        <li>They conceded the opening goal in the eighth minute so were already 1-0 down when they were reduced to 10 men in the 21st minute after midfielder Aldaire Santos was sent-off and thereafter they never looked likely to salvage anything from the match.</li>
        <li>Although competitive wins are rare for Sao Tome they won their last competitive home match, a 2-1 victory against Mauritius in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualification preliminary round last month.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>GHANA</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Four-time Africa Cup of Nations champions Ghana made a strong start to their qualifying campaign for the 2021 finals with a 2-0 win against South Africa on Thursday at the Cape Coast stadium.</li>
        <li>Atletico Madrid’s Thomas Partey opened the scoring in the first half and substitute Kudus celebrated his first cap by finding the net late on in the second to see off the challenge of South Africa.</li>
        <li>Ghana will be expecting to leave with nothing less than three points as they have an excellent record in AFCON qualifying with only two defeats from their last 26 qualifying games.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>THE PREDICTION</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ghana made a good start to their quest for qualification with a 2-0 win against South Africa and they will be looking to make it two wins from two matches with victory against Sao Tome &amp; Principe who are the lowest ranked team in the group. Ghana have sufficient quality to ensure they don’t have any kind of slip up in this match and expect them to leave with a comfortable enough victory.</p>
