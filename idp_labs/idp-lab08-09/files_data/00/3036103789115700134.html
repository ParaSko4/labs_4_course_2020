      <h1>Cell C signs new 4G roaming plan with MTN</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/jamie-mckane" target="_blank">Jamie McKane</a></address>
      <p>Cell C and MTN have signed an expanded roaming agreement which would see Cell C reduce its expenditure on building out its national infrastructure.</p>
      <p>This new deal builds on the existing roaming agreement that the two mobile networks entered into in 2018, which provided 3G and 4G services to Cell C customers outside of main metros.</p>
      <p>The new roaming agreement expands on this and extends Cell C’s 4G network coverage to 95% of the population.</p>
      <p>Cell C customers will have access to over 12,500 sites, of which 90% are LTE-enabled.</p>
      <p>“This is a pivotal step in Cell C’s turnaround strategy,” said Cell C CEO Douglas Craigie Stevenson.</p>
      <p>“One of the key pillars of this turnaround is to implement a revised network strategy that enables Cell C to manage its network capacity requirements in a more cost-efficient and scalable manner.”</p>
      <h3>Reducing costs</h3>
      <p>Cell C said that this agreement is in line with shifts in the global telecoms industry towards more cost-effective network strategies, adding that there are already local examples of this type of roaming agreement in South Africa.</p>
      <p>“This roaming agreement is transformative for Cell C,” Craigie Stevenson said. “The company is no longer encumbered by the high costs of building a network footprint and we can focus our energy and efforts into developing innovative and disruptive service offerings that will be welcomed by data-hungry consumers.”</p>
      <p>“This is a win-win all round as it has long-term benefits for the economy, the industry and ultimately consumers.”</p>
      <p>The company said the new roaming agreement adheres to all applicable legal and regulatory requirements, adding that Cell C and MTN will maintain their spectrum and each party will use its own frequencies.</p>
      <p>Cell C will retain its licences and control of its core network, transmission, billing system, and subscriber management.</p>
      <p>The implementation of the expanded roaming agreement will commence in early 2020 and the transition is expected to take up to 36 months to complete.</p>
      <h3>Cell C turnaround strategy</h3>
      <p>Cell C CFO Zaf Mahomed said the company’s turnaround plan had been effective, with the business seeing incremental improvements to its bottom line since improving operational efficiencies.</p>
      <p>“The management focus on retaining profitable customers and expenditure savings has generated meaningful positive cash flow improvement on a month on month basis,” Mahomed said.</p>
      <p>“It is a good sign that we are doing the right things and are on the road to recovery.”</p>
