      <p>Mikel raved about the 28-year-old's undoubted ability but gave a less positive assessment of his work ethic when asked to name the laziest player he trained alongside.</p>
      <p>"Hazard has incredible talent," the Nigerian told beIN SPORTS in Turkey.</p>
      <p>"<b>Maybe not as good as [Lionel] Messi</b>, but he can do whatever he wants with the ball at his feet. <b>He didn't like to train hard</b>. While we were working he was waiting for us to finish training just standing there. But on Sundays he was always man of the match, it was unbelievable."</p>
      <p>Mikel, a Champions League winner with Chelsea, named current Blues boss <b>Frank Lampard the hardest trainer he has seen</b>.</p>
