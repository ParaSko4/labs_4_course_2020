      <p>Pressure group Youth Patriotic Movement has hailed the Akufo-Addo-led government over its social policy interventions since taking office in 2017.</p>
      <p>According to the group, the implementation of key policies such as the Free SHS, Planting for Food and Jobs, One-District One-Factory, Nation Builders Corps (NABCo) and a host of others confirms the government’s positive performance so far.</p>
      <p>“Under the leadership of His Excellency Nana Akufo Addo, we the youth of the country are enjoying free SHS,” the group said in a release on Monday.</p>
      <p>“Our parents who were not able to buy fertilizers and other farm inputs are now also enjoying from the Planting for Food and Jobs Project. University graduates who were seriously frustrated to the extent of forming the Unemployment Graduate Association have now been absorbed into the NABCo modules, getting some monthly stipends to support themselves and their families”.</p>
      <p>Youth Patriotic Movement is also calling on Ghanaians to support President Akufo-Addo’s bid for a second term in office come 2020.</p>
      <p>“We have come to realize that the current government has done a lot in that direction and deserve commendation.”</p>
      <p>It added: “By this, it would be prudent to support this government in its quest to get the nod for a second term, to stabilize the economy and continue to create employment avenues for the youth”.</p>
