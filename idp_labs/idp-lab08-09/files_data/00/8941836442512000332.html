      <p>STANFORD, Calif. (AP) - Lexie Hull was unable to play against Gonzaga last year, making a game against her hometown team this season even more special.</p>
      <p>Hull scored eight points and grabbed a big rebound in the final 3 minutes and No. 3 <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> beat Gonzaga 76-70 in overtime Sunday night.</p>
      <p>After shooting under 38 percent in the first half, including a 2 of 14 effort from 3-point range, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> started looking to get to the basket in the second half and the adjustment paid off.</p>
      <p>“We know that sometimes the offense won’t be there, so you focus on defense,” Hull said. “You have to stay positive and stick together.”</p>
      <p>Hull finished with 20 points and eight rebounds to help the Cardinal (4-0) avenge a 79-73 road loss to the Bulldogs (2-1) last December.</p>

      <p>Kiana Williams scored 20 of her 22 points after halftime. Haley Jones added 11.</p>
      <p>“That was a huge learning experience for us, especially for the freshmen,” Williams said. “Against Gonzaga, you have to lock in. For the freshmen getting this type of game was huge.”</p>
      <p>Jill Townsend scored 18 points before fouling out in overtime to lead the Bulldogs. Kayleigh Truong and Melody Kempton each added 12 and Jessie Loera had 10.</p>
      <p>“We’re disappointed,” Bulldogs coach Lisa Fortier said. “We think we’re deep and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> has player after player they can bring in. We didn’t defend as well as we needed down the stretch</p>

        <p>Hull sank a pair of free throws with 3 minutes to play, putting <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> ahead to stay at 65-64. She then came up with an offensive rebound following a missed free throw and went inside for another basket.</p>
        <p>Seconds later, she recorded a steal and went the distance for a layup, giving <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> a 69-64 edge.</p>
        <p>“Lexie made some big shots, some big free throws and played great defense,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> coach Tara VanDerveer said. “Gonzaga was aggressive and extremely physical and we had to battle through some turnovers.”</p>
        <p>While <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> won a first-round NCAA Tournament game at home against Gonzaga in 2018, the Zags also stole a 68-63 victory at Maples Pavilion on Nov. 18, 2016.</p>
        <p>Townsend tied it at 60 with 48 seconds remaining in regulation, hitting a big 3-pointer and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> missed a shot at the other end.</p>
        <p>“I just had to step up with a lot of confidence to hit that shot,” Townsend said. “We got big shots at the right moments to put ourselves in position.”</p>
        <p>Loera made a pair of free throws to put Gonzaga ahead with 17 seconds left, but Williams responded with a driving layup 9 seconds later to force overtime.</p>
        <p>THE SERIES</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> began playing Gonzaga in 2009 and have played 11 times. “Not a lot of teams want to come to Spokane,” Zags coach Lisa Fortier said. “It’s a very valuable experience for us to play <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a>. It’s an opportunity to test each other early. We both have gritty, feisty players. We rely on a game like this, which is playoff-like, tournament-like.” The Cardinal improved to 9-2 in the series and 36-4 facing the WCC over the past 20 years.</p>
        <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
        <p>Gonzaga: The Zags faced their first ranked opponent of the season. They have never won two in a row against <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a>, which beat the Zags 82-68 in the first round of the NCAA Tournament in March 2018 at Maples Pavilion. The Bulldogs are 19-67 overall against Pac-12 opponents, 6-8 under coach Lisa Fortier.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a>: The Cardinal faced a tough, physical team that maintained that pace throughout for the first time and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> needed to make a few adjustments. “We weren’t as aggressive as we needed to be,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> coach Tara VanDerveer said. “I thought we settled for a lot of long 3’s. We needed to pound it inside.”</p>
