      <p>Go to any industry outside of the telecommunications (telco) industry and ask any CTO, "What has been the most disruptive, technical innovation that impacted your business in the last decade?" The answer will invariably include the incredible disruption of the public cloud. Companies like Netflix, Spotify and Lyft would not exist, and certainly, our lives would not be better off without them, had public cloud not become a reality in the mid-2000s. But the public cloud is nowhere to be seen in telco. Instead of operators implementing those learnings in our industry, I often hear, "I can’t move to the public cloud.”Likewise, I read article after article about operators struggling financially, and they don’t know what to do next. With up-and-coming challenger brands nipping at their heels, the biggest idea for cost savings might be staring them right in the face: Move their workloads to the public cloud — and soon.</p>
      <p>So what are the most common misconceptions when it comes to the public cloud and telco? Let's take a look at the top three.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Myth 1: Public cloud is more expensive.</b>
      </p>
      <p>By moving to the public cloud, some operators have been able to save <a href="https://optiva.com/wp-content/uploads/Disaster_Recovery_On_Public_Cloud.pdf">almost 80%</a> on the total cost of ownership (TCO) of running a complex software application. To truly understand the cost savings that telcos can achieve, you must consider the entire stack — from the ground on which servers sit to the people who manage various applications.</p>
      <p>The TCO here includes the cost of installation, database licenses, hardware, power, management time and many other factors. With the public cloud, you don’t need to buy hardware, and there are no data center costs, such as real estate, power operation, security and staffing. You are able to eliminate expensive third-party database software and remove disaster recovery and static testbeds. Also, traditional monolithic applications running on-premise result in slow testing and release procedures.</p>
      <p>The public cloud frees operators from all of these requirements, empowering them to be more agile and reduce TCO. Of course, some operators may already have a significant investment in on-premise servers for the private cloud. However, those that fail to migrate core functions to the public cloud stand to lose their competitive market position in the long run.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Myth 2: Public cloud is not secure.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Today’s telecom operators increasingly are expected to know and comply with security and privacy laws that change radically across different countries, regulatory bodies and even policies within individual companies. It’s usually the first objection raised about moving to the public cloud.</p>
      <p>Many telco CTOs don’t know that cloud offerings from large cloud providers, like Google, Amazon and Microsoft, must meet stringent guidelines for security and privacy. For instance, Google, a technology partner of ours, spent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-13/google-to-spend-13-billion-on-data-centers-offices-across-u-s">$9 billion</a> last year alone to build data centers and implement security, earning it a place as a <a href="https://go.forrester.com/blogs/predictions-2019-cloud-computing/">Forrester Wave</a> cloud platform security leader. Telcos cannot match that level of investment in innovation and security. Moreover, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/is-the-cloud-secure/">Gartner </a>anticipates that public cloud workloads will see 60% fewer cybersecurity incidents than standard data centers through 2020.</p>
      <p>What public cloud features demonstrate superior security? Look for vendors that commit to the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Layered defense with strong perimeters and surveillance on cloud data centers.</li>
        <li>Highly controlled access, preventing any unauthorized partner, vendor or employee from entering with defense depth controls at every layer.</li>
        <li>Encryption at rest by default.</li>
        <li>Transparency through frequent third-party certifications and audits.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <b>Myth 3: If it runs on a cloud, you get all the benefits of a public cloud.</b>
      </p>
      <p>There’s a tendency to use the term “cloud-native” without truly understanding what it is or its benefits. For some telco CTOs, vendor terminology such as “cloud-ready” can be confusing and misleading, and making the transition to the cloud can require a steep learning curve. Yet, taking the time to educate yourself can help ensure that the strategies you're considering are genuinely fit for your needs. An operator that can only run in the private cloud — or that <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/business-employment/business-transformation/nice-turns-nasty-as-vendors-face-fire-over-cloud-native-claims/d/d-id/751460">drops existing software architecture</a> onto Azure, AWS or GCP — is not cloud-native. This type of “lift and shift” exercise cannot leverage the full benefits of the public cloud.</p>
      <p>Truly cloud-native applications must be architected with 21st century technology. If an application that claims to be “cloud-ready” or “cloud-native” still requires an old-school Oracle relational database, it’s not cloud-native. Applications that are truly suited to the cloud will take advantage of a containerization approach to development, such as Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.</p>
      <p>Further, truly cloud-native applications are faster and more powerful, and they enable operators to avoid traditional license fees.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Revealing The Truth</b>
      </p>
      <p>Given the popularity of running enterprise workloads in the cloud, it’s not surprising that telecom operators are beginning to recognize the importance of cloud migration. It’s not only crucial to understand the different types of cloud offerings, but you must also realize how those differences will impact your business and your bottom line.</p>
      <p>For example, telcos may decide to take an interim half-step and move their enterprise software applications onto a self-provisioned and self-managed private cloud. By using containerization systems such as Kubernetes, you could take this step to maximize your investment in any hardware or database licenses you may already own.</p>
      <p>Ongoing advances in technology have presented operators with a series of new opportunities, along with the inevitable accompanying challenges. As demand for data continues to grow, requiring new network capacity, and as traffic patterns become increasingly unpredictable, new solutions are needed. In a <a href="https://ovum.informa.com/~/media/informa-shop-window/tmt/whitepapers-and-pr/understanding-the-business-value-of-re-architecting-core-applications-on-the-public-cloud-pdf.pdf">recent Ovum </a>report, analyst Roy Illsley wrote, “Ovum believes that for telecoms companies to be able to compete in the digital world, the adoption of public cloud is inevitable.”</p>
      <p>With the current explosion in IoT connectivity and several 5G networks set to launch this year and in 2020, application data will grow exponentially. Now is the time for telecommunications leaders to dispel the myths and make the move to the public cloud.</p>
