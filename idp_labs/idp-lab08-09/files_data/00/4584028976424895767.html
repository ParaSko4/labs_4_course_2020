      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://sportsmax.tv/index.php/studentwriters/itemlist/user/805-leightonlevy" target="_blank">Leighton Levy</a></address>
      <p>Randy Brown pulled off a dramatic win during his most recent MMA fight at the Ginásio do Ibirapuera in Sao Paulo in Brazil on Saturday and believes the impressive manner of the victory positions him to challenge for a title soon.</p>
      <p>In fact, in his post-fight comments, he called out highly touted veteran Michael Chiesa.</p>
      <p>Chiesa is the winner of the Ultimate Fighter Reality Show and boasts a record of 16 wins and four losses.</p>
      <p>Brown improved his record to 12-3 when he defeating Warlley Alves by submission in the second round of their fight in Brazil on Saturday night. The Brazilian tapped out 1:22s into the round after taking some heavy shots from the Jamaican, who said his ability to adapt was key to his impressive win.</p>
      <p>“A major key to this victory was my overall adaptability, the ability to be dangerous in all aspects of the fight,” Brown told Sportsmax.TV on Sunday while on his way back to the United States from Brazil.</p>
      <p>Brown fell a couple of times into the fight but each time recovered well enough to gain an advantage on his fearsome opponent who fell to his fourth defeat in 17 fights.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t expect to slip and fall so early in the match but my adaptability and being well trained in all aspects of fighting I was to work my way from a bad position and reverse the position by the end of the round,” he said.</p>
      <p>“In Round 2, I came out strong with a few strong combinations that hurt him. When I went in for the kill, I slipped and fell again but was able to rely on my grappling skill to submit him with a triangle choke.</p>
      <p>“It’s a big win in my opponent’s home country. This moves me closer to the ranking and potential title challenges.”</p>
