      <p>Both Gardaí and the family of Kevin McGrath are extremely anxious to locate him, and gardaí have asked anyone with information to call Galway Garda Station on 091 538 000, the Garda Confidential Line on 1800 666 111 or any Garda Station in the country.</p>
      <p>The Galway community and the family of Mr McGrath have also launched a social media appeal in the hopes that someone may have seen him.</p>
      <p>A post by Mr McGrath's daughter Claire stressed that the sighting in Eyre Square on October 27th was unconfirmed, and urged people to contact Gardaí if they believed they may have seen him somewhere before that date "as the Guards will not carry out an official search unless they receive further leads".</p>
