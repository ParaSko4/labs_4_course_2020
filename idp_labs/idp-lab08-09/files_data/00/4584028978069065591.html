      <p>William Knibbs shot a final-round even-par 72 on Sunday to win the 2019 Alliance Buccaneer Memorial Gold Tournament at the Caymanas Golf Course in St. Catherine.</p>
      <p>Knibbs led the Men &amp; Men Senior (0-6 handicap) category from day one when he was one of only two golfers to record an under-par score of 71, the other being Lloyd Campbell. His final day score came courtesy of two birdies and an eagle that offset potential damage of two bogeys and a double bogey.</p>
      <p>He finished with an overall score of 143, four shots clear of National Amateur golf champion Sean Morris, who recovered from sixth on the first day when he shot a 77, to closing with a 70 for a combined score of 147.</p>
      <p>"I was really happy with the win this weekend because it validated the hard work that I have been putting in for the past few weeks,” said Knibbs.</p>
      <p>“I'd been struggling somewhat with my game for the last few months, so it was just nice to be able to pull off all the shots in competition."</p>
      <p>Zandre Roye, who shot a 79 on the opening day, closed Sunday with a 71 to claim third. 2018 champion Justin Burrowes finished fourth after rounds of 76 and 75 that saw him finish fourth with an overall score of 151.</p>
      <p>Wesley Brown won the professional segment of the tournament having shot scores of 73 and 70 for the two-day event. Sean Green (147) was second with an overall score of 147 (77 and 70) over the two rounds.</p>
      <p>First-day leader, Lloyd Campbell, scored 71 and 77 for third. </p>
      <p>Perennial female winner Jodi Munn-Barrow played consistently to score 76 on both days (152) to take the Ladies category. She said that the conditions were good for golf but it was rough in some areas. Michelle Gabay scored 88 and 81 for the two days (169) for the second spot.</p>
      <p>The Men &amp; Men Senior (7-12 handicap) went to Philip Gooden who carded 77 and 82 for a total score of 159.  Luke Lindo was seven strokes back on 166. Kristian Chin 167 grabbed the third spot with scores of 82 and 85.</p>
      <p>Former JGA President Wayne Chai Chong took the Men Super Senior title with scores of 80 and 74, respectively. Robert Chin was one shot back in second while Teddy Alexander took third with an overall score of 158.</p>
      <p>The awards presentation ceremony is scheduled for Saturday, November 30 at the Caymanas Golf Club in St. Catherine.</p>
