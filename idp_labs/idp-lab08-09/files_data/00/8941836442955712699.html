      <p>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - A Tennessee man says he wants an overhaul of a school program that killed the emu he hatched with his late wife.</p>
      <p>The Tennessean quotes Jeff Norman as saying the bird named Charlie was one of the couple’s last projects before Jil Norman’s death in 2018. He says he then found a place for Charlie at McGavock High School, which he and his family later would visit to reminisce about his wife.</p>
      <p>Science teacher Jessica Lumpkins was charged with animal cruelty last week during a surprise inspection by Metro Animal Care and Control, which previously said the emu was thin. The 33-year-old was cited with animal cruelty in March after four school alpacas died. System spokesman Sean Braisted says animals are being removed from McGavock, which Lumpkins has since left.</p>
