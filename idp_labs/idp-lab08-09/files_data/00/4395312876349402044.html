      <p>Despite the important role sleep plays in the quality of our lives, approximately one-third of adults fail to get a good night’s sleep every day. [1]</p>
      <p>It can be a real challenge to fall asleep when your mind is alert with anxious thoughts about work, bills and life.</p>
      <p>But, if we don’t learn to sleep well, how can we perform at our best every day? Good sleep gives us the necessary energy, health and mental edge required to make consistent progress towards our goals.</p>
      <p>One of the best ways to fall asleep quicker is by practicing deep breathing exercises. [2]</p>
      <p>Here’s one of the most effective techniques—it’s called the “4-7-8” breathing technique.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The 4-7-8 Breathing Technique</b>
      </p>
      <p>Harvard trained medical doctor, Dr. Andrew Weil, first introduced the “4-7-8” breathing technique to help people alleviate anxiety and sleep quicker. [3]</p>
      <p>Here’s how it works.</p>
      <p><b>Step 1:</b> Sit down on a chair and keep your back straight.</p>
      <p><b>Step 2:</b> Place the tip of your tongue against the mouth tissue just behind your upper front teeth. </p>
      <p><b>Step 3:</b> Inhale for <b>4</b> seconds</p>
      <p><b>Step 4:</b> Hold your breath for <b>7</b> seconds</p>
      <p><b>Step 5:</b> Exhale (through your mouth) for <b>8</b> seconds</p>
      <p>Congratulations, you just completed one round of “4-7-8” breathing. Rinse and repeat for at least 4 rounds. [4]</p>
      <p><b>Note:</b> Make sure to keep your tongue in the same position throughout. You can also repeat this exercise twice or more every day. If you feel light headed at any point stop the exercise.</p>
