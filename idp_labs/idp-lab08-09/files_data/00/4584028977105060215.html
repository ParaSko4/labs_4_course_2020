      <h1>Former Aussie captain believes in Pooran talent despite ‘slip up’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://sportsmax.tv/index.php/studentwriters/itemlist/user/803-paulandrewalker" target="_blank">Paul-Andre Walker</a></address>
      <p>A Nicholas Pooran-less West Indies did not have the power to deal with Afghanistan over the course of a three-match T20I series, the wicketkeeper/batsman missing out while he serves a four-match ban over ball tampering.</p>
      <p>Steve Smith, who had been banned for a year for the part he played in a ball-tampering scandal, lost his captaincy of Australia, and is only months back with the side.</p>
      <p>Pooran was only banned for four games but Smith doesn’t feel the talented middle-order batsman should be punished anymore harshly.</p>
      <p>"Everyone is different, every board is different, and the way they deal with certain issues. For me, I copped it on the chin... it is what it is,” he said.</p>
      <p>Smith expects a better Pooran to come out of the embarrassment of being caught cheating.</p>
      <p>“I know Nicholas, I've played a bit of cricket with him and he's a talented player and someone with a bright future," Smith said.</p>
      <p>"I think he'll learn from his mistake and move past it,” he said.</p>
      <p>I played with him in the Caribbean league at Barbados. I think he's going to be an exceptional player in white-ball cricket."</p>
