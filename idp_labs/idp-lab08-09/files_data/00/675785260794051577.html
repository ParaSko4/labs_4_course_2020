      <p>Manchester United and Arsenal are keeping tabs on Hartlepool goalkeeper Brad Young, according to reports.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old stopper, who has been with Hartlepool for five years, signed his first professional deal with the National League side during the summer.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10364285/man-utd-arsenal-hartlepool-brad-young/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=sunfootballtwitter&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1574017799">The Sun</a> claims that his quick progress for Pools' youth team has seen him catch the eye of the Gunners and Red Devils.</p>
      <p>Young, who already stands out at an imposing 6ft 4in, has continued to impress so far this season and has had earned an England youth call-up.</p>
      <p>According to the publication, the non-league side are likely to demand a decent transfer fee from the Premier League duo if he continues to show quick improvement.</p>
      <p>Despite only turning 17 in May, Young has already attracted interest from teams in the Football League.</p>

      <p>Before penning his contract with Hartlepool, he chose to turn down an offer from a League One club to continue his development at Victoria Park.</p>
      <p>And he already has his sights set on making his senior debut for Dave Challinor's first team.</p>
      <p>After signing his professional contract, Young told <a href="https://www.hartlepoolunited.co.uk/brad-young-signs-pro-contract-with-pools/">Hartlepool's website</a> : “I have loved every minute since I came to the Club as an Under 13 and have worked under some great coaches along the way – in particular, Chris Errington and Ross Turnbull have worked closely with me, really helped me to develop and given me the best chance.</p>

      <p>“I am delighted to be staying with my local club and I now I want to keep on making progress.</p>
      <p>“I have worked hard to get where I am, but I know that the hard work really starts now – I feel like I am starting afresh, and I want to push on as much as I can.</p>
      <p>“I want to make my First Team debut somewhere down the line so I am going to do everything I can to give myself the best opportunity to do that.”</p>
