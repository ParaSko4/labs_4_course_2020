      <h1>Security tightened at Indonesian airports after Medan suicide bombing</h1>

      <p>Passengers travelling through 19 airports in Indonesia would be wise to arrive at the airport earlier for their flights, as enhanced security measures are being implemented in response to a suicide bombing in Medan on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Six people were wounded when a 24-year-old lone wolf suicide bomber blew himself up outside police headquarters in Medan at 09:00am, <i>Reuters </i>reported. On Saturday, two men who allegedly assembled the bomb used in the attack were shot dead in a gun fight with police, according to <i>The Jakarta Post</i>.</p>
      <p>PT Angkasa Pura II (Persero), one of the country’s state enterprises that manages airports, said in a press release that the enhanced security would take the form of conducting random checks on airline passengers and their luggages.</p>
      <p>Random checks are carried out at the security check point (SCP), which is an inspection area with a metal detector and x-ray, the press release added. Each airport has two SCPs: SCP 1 where the inspection is carried out before the passengers enter the check-in area, and SCP 2 where the inspection is carried out before the passengers enter the boarding lounge.</p>
      <p>Random checks will be also carried out on vehicles and people who want to enter the airport area and terminal building.</p>
      <p>Security is also being tightened at the Access Control Point (ACP), which is the point where vehicles or workers enter the airside of the airport.</p>
      <p>In addition, a K9 Unit of sniffer dogs has also been deployed to inspect luggage and bags.</p>
      <p>Angkasa Pura II said it has “ensured that flights at 19 airports are still running normally and smoothly”, without providing a list of the airports. The <a href="https://www.angkasapura2.co.id/en/home">company’s website</a> lists only 15 airports under a section titled “Our Airports”. A spokesperson for Angkasa Pura II could not be reached for clarification.</p>
      <p>Angkasa Pura II mostly manages airports in the western part of Indonesia.</p>

        <b>Cathay’s Medan route</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hong Kong airline Cathay Dragon suspended its flights to Medan at the end of October. <i>Business Traveller </i>Asia-Pacific asked Cathay whether it plans to reintroduce the route, and whether the recent bombing would negatively impact its decision to reintroduce that route.</p>
      <p>“We regularly review our network of destinations in accordance with market demand,” a spokesperson said in response.</p>
