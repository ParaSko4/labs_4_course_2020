      <h1>Watch a Galaxy Form Over More Than 13 Billion Years</h1>
      <h2>Scientists had to speed the simulation up just a little bit.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://futurism.com/authors/kristin" target="_blank">Kristin Houser</a></address>
      <p>Using a powerful supercomputer, scientists have created a state-of-the-art simulation of galactic formation.</p>
      <p>While previous simulations typically had to choose between showing a big-picture view or being highly detailed, the <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/galaxy-simulation-tng50/">TNG50 simulation</a> is both. Not only does it show how a whole universe may have formed in the 13.8 years since the <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/nobel-scientist-big-bang-never-happened">Big Bang</a>, but it also gives scientists the ability to zoom in and see an individual galaxy form in incredible detail.</p>
      <p>Perhaps most exciting of all: the team behind TNG50 shared a clip of one of those simulated galaxies online for your viewing pleasure.</p>

      <p>TNG50 was a collaborative undertaking between scientists in Germany and the United States, who published <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/490/3/3196/5566345">two</a> <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/490/3/3234/5556547">papers</a> on the simulation in the journal <i>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</i> earlier in November.</p>
      <p>It took the <a href="https://www.hlrs.de/systems/cray-xc40-hazel-hen/">Hazel Hen supercomputer</a> in Stuttgart, Germany, more than a year to complete the simulation, which — like <a href="https://futurism.com/worlds-first-ai-universe-simulator">similar visualizations</a> — largely works backwards from what scientists already believe about the universe to predict the activity that led to the current state of affairs.</p>
      <p>While being able to see a galaxy form over billions of years is cool in and of itself, the simulation did more than just produce a visual for known data — it also provided several new insights, including previously unknown details on the process of disc galaxy formation.</p>
      <p>“Numerical experiments of this kind are particularly successful when you get out more than you put in,” researcher Dylan Nelson said in a <a href="https://ras.ac.uk/news-and-press/research-highlights/galactic-fountains-and-carousels-order-emerging-chaos">press release</a>. “In our simulation, we see phenomena that had not been programmed explicitly into the simulation code. These phenomena emerge in a natural fashion, from the complex interplay of the basic physical ingredients of our model universe.”</p>
      <p>The researchers plan to eventually release all of the data from TNG50, giving other scientists the opportunity to look for even more new phenomena in the state-of-the-art simulation.</p>
