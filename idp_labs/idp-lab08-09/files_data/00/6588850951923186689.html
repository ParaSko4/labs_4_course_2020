      <p>The Black Stars completed two training sessions on the yet to be completed Astro turf facility at the Libya Quarters Madina. <br/><br/>Many were overwhelmed by the project being constructed by Wembley Sports Construction Company Limited. <br/><br/>One of the people amazed by the world class edifice is Black Stars captained Andre Ayew who was quick to praise the men behind the project. “First of all I want to thank the authorities for this facility in Madina, this is the best astro turf I have played on and and I was surprised when I was told a Ghanaian built it. Not just me but all the players are happy playing on this and we want to come here often to play”.<br/><br/>The Swansea City top marks man believes the construction of these facilities in other areas will help restore our juvenile football. “I grew up here in Madina and we never had this, this is world class and having this everywhere in the country will help unearth and enhance the talents among the young ones, which kid will not like to play on a pitch like this? So I think the government must help provide more of this in the northern, eastern, western and central parts of the country and we will produce greater players than we have now”.<br/>The Black Stars take on São Tomé and Principe today in the second game of the 2021 AFCON qualifiers.</p>
