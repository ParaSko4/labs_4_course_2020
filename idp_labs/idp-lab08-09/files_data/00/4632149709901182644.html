      <p><i>Man absconds after leaving friend’s bike completely gutted</i> <br/><br/>A man burnt his friend’s bike over a trivial issue in the midnight on Friday.

      <p>Manjunath's Charred Bike</p>
      <p>Manjunath, 27, a resident of Papayya Reddy Layout, has filed a complaint with the Marathahalli police, who are currently on the lookout for the accused. The accused has been identified as Praveen, 21, a resident of Marathahalli. Praveen is unemployed. Manjunath, who owns a garage, had purchased a Pulsar bike of the latest model six months ago. Manjunath said that on Friday, he had finished his work and returned home around 11:45 pm and parked his bike near his house. “Around 1 am, I heard a lot of noise coming from outside and woke up. I ran out and noticed that my bike was on fire and my neighbours were trying to douse it. It took sometime to get the fire under control, but the bike was completely gutted.” <br/><br/>He alerted the police who rushed to the spot and began looking around for clues. “Praveen and other friends came to my house and helped me and the police to search for clues and look at the CCTV footage. When Praveen learnt that there was a CCTV camera that had captured him entering our lane at the time of the incident, he went into hiding immediately,” said Manjunath.</p>

      <p>Manjunath said he was shocked to see Praveen in the footage. The footage shows Praveen coming on a scooter along with two friends, who stopped the vehicle near the house and Praveen was seen walking towards the bike. “Within minutes, he walked out and fled the place with his friends. I always treated him like my little brother and when he came to my house on Friday night, he seemed a little drunk. But I am not sure what was the reason behind his act.” <br/><br/>He said that he had tried getting in touch with his other friends to know about Praveen’s whereabouts but did not find anything. “The bike was brand new and was completely damaged. It cost me about Rs. 70,000,” he said. <br/><br/>Marathahalli police have registered a case and are on the lookout for Praveen and his two friends. Police said that of the three, only Praveen has been identified so far.</p>
