      <p>The performance of value has sucked for some time now. Since <a href="https://osam.com/Commentary/value-is-dead-long-live-value">2007</a>, in fact. This has prompted a flurry of articles questioning whether value investing is, in fact, dead. However, sometimes we can achieve better outcomes by asking better questions. In this case the better question is should value investing still be part of a multi-factor portfolio? And the answer seems to be yes. The supporting evidence here appears substantial.</p>
      <h3>Multi-Factors vs. Single Factor</h3>
      <p>If you’re placing a bet on value as a standalone factor, then maybe you’re doing it wrong. <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3400998">Research</a> from Antti Ilmanen and colleagues at AQR has shown that combining factors can lead to improved outcomes and risk management over time.</p>
      <p>This may not fit how we like to make decisions. We like to know if something works or not. We like to get to yes or no answers. But we can make better decisions by moving away from binary yes or no choices. Historically combining factors has been a neat strategy and a less risky one. That strategy has worked historically continued to work in past years, even as value has lagged. A multi-factor strategy is likely to continue to work in future if history is any guide.</p>
      <p>For example, yes value has had a rough decade and counting. That’s enough to test anyone’s patience. But another factor, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2019/01/27/a-deeper-look-at-how-momentum-strategies-work/#59c5072e5ae3">momentum</a>, is doing very well over the same period. There’s some evidence that value and momentum can help balance each other over time as <a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=231116021119094067025086112097065121018062034043090044011067090076100005106088113104029123096099014032005007118000124007087096037012043042080125117115069088065106056062015125093099016088106000083100005116030066067027065000100074005087099125093102008&amp;EXT=pdf">Meb Faber has documented</a>. So the overall model still holds, factors can still help your portfolio. It’s just in recent history momentum has carried the load while momentum has lagged.</p>
      <p>Does that mean that we should load up on value and drop momentum now? Well, no. sadly, it’s tough to time factors. Yes, momentum may lag at some point in the future and value will more than likely have it’s day once again. But this is hard to forecast. In addition, doing so can increase the costs of trading and potentially taxes too. </p>
      <p>As such, let’s not make it hard for ourselves by picking factors in isolation and trying to time them. Consider owning them in combination. That way we’ll perhaps see some risk reduction from owning factors together. </p>
      <p>Yes, we’ll be frustrated when a particular factor (currently value) does not deliver and consider adding more of whatever’s working well (currently momentum). However, the data is persuasive that these factors a pretty hard to time effectively. So continuing to hold factors in balance may be the better plan.</p>
      <h3>The Wrong Question</h3>
      <p>If you’re wondering if value is dead, you are asking the wrong question. The question is do factors continue to work in combination? Of course, value isn’t pulling its weight right now, but that’s historically pretty normal. For example, <a href="https://osam.com/Commentary/value-is-dead-long-live-value">value underperformed between 1926 and 1941</a>. If you end up throwing it out or going all in on it on alternate factors, based on your view, all you’ll likely do is hurt your returns going forward. </p>
      <p>Historically spreading your bets across factors has been smart, and there’s little reason to think that’s going to change. Don’t completely give up on value, but don’t necessarily double-down on it either. It has a place in many portfolios, just like many other things. Binary choices on value investing may cause worse outcomes. Let’s ask better questions and consider how factors work in combination.</p>
