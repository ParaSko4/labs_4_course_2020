      <p>Honda has given the Civic a mild-refresh for 2020, improving the interior, styling and infotainment system.</p>
      <p>The Japanese brand says it enhanced the car’s “premium feel” yet retained its dynamic performance.</p>
      <p>The revised Civic features a new symmetrical lower front grille around the fog lights, with smoothed surfaces and sleek styling blades. A simpler grille beam configuration and new air-intake design give the front profile a cleaner, more aerodynamic design.</p>
      <p>Upgrades to the Civic’s face also include full LED headlight clusters fitted as standard across the range, and redesigned LED daytime running lights.</p>
      <p>New 16-inch alloy wheels are available for the entry-level model, while mid- and top-range models can be styled with sporty ‘Shark Grey’ 17-inch ones.</p>
      <p>Textured interior panels improve the interior’s sense of quality, while an electric eight-way adjustable driver’s seat is now available on top-of-the-range models.</p>
      <p>The connected infotainment system incorporates Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, plus Honda has enhanced usability by adding physical buttons and dials for the infotainment and climate controls, in response to customer demand.</p>

      <p>The Civic retains its range of petrol and diesel engines. The 1.0-litre VTEC Turbo unit, with 126PS achieves CO2 emissions from 107g/km, while the 1.5-litre VTEC Turbo produces 182PS and emissions from 128g/km.</p>
      <p>Honda’s recently revised 1.6 litre i-DTEC diesel engine offers 120PS with emissions of 90g/km when equipped with the six-speed manual transmission, and fuel economy of 62.8 mpg.</p>
      <p>Customers will be able to test drive the 2020 Civic in dealerships from January 2020.</p>
