      <h1>New WhatsApp video security flaw</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/staff-writer" target="_blank">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>A new WhatsApp security vulnerability leaves users’ files and messages exposed to access from attackers.</p>
      <p>Facebook issued a<a href="https://web.facebook.com/security/advisories/cve-2019-11931?_rdc=1&amp;_rdr"><b> security advisory</b></a> last week which warned WhatsApp Messenger users that a modified MP4 video file could be used to initiate remote code execution (RCE) and denial of service (DoS) attacks.</p>
      <p>“A stack-based buffer overflow could be triggered in WhatsApp by sending a specially crafted MP4 file to a WhatsApp user,” the advisory stated.</p>
      <p>The susceptibility could make it possible for malicious actors to gain access to messages and files stored on a compromised device.</p>
      <p>Both the consumer versions of the Android and iOS app, as well as the Enterprise and Business editions have been affected.</p>
      <p>Facebook said that Android versions prior to 2.19.274 and iOS versions older than 2.19.100 are vulnerable.</p>
      <h3>Latest updates fix the issue</h3>
      <p>WhatsApp has rolled out a patch for the vulnerability, meaning that more recent versions than those mentioned above, should be safe from attack.</p>
      <p>Users who are running older versions of WhatsApp are encouraged to update their app.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://news.softpedia.com/news/whatsapp-resolves-critical-mp4-security-vulnerability-exposing-messages-528195.shtml"><b>Softpedia</b></a>, there appear to be no reported cases of exploits of the flaw at this time.</p>
      <p>News of this vulnerability follows the discovery of a previous exploit in WhatsApp’s Calling feature, which made it possible to install malware on a targeted device, giving hackers total control of the victim’s smartphone.</p>
      <p>At the end of last month, WhatsApp <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/security/325567-whatsapp-files-lawsuit-over-spyware-exploit.html"><b>announced</b></a> it was suing Israeli-based cyber intelligence organisation NSO Group for its suspected involvement in the development of this malware.</p>
