      <p>Dino Melaye, candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the Kogi-West Senatorial District rerun, has rejected the results released by the Independent National Electoral Commission.</p>
      <p>INEC conducted a rerun of the senatorial election in the district and announced Smart Adeyemi, candidate of the All Progressives Congress as winner.</p>
      <p>The court had earlier declared the election conducted in the state as null and void while ordering the INEC to conduct a new election for the office. </p>
      <p>Dino, winner of the previous election, lost in the latest one, describing the results as “magic”.</p>
      <p>At a press conference in Abuja, Melaye accused Adeyemi and Governor Yahaya Bello of using violence, intimidation and inducement to frustrate the electorate in areas where he was popular.</p>
      <p>He said, “Three people were shot and two died; four people were killed in Lokoja; seven were killed in the eastern part of the state; this is the record we have so far, apart from those who sustained gunshot wounds.</p>
      <p>Melaye further alleged that the results of Iyara, Adeyemi’s hometown, were written while mayhem was unleashed on his hometown of Aiyetoro-Gbede which claimed the life of his nephew, Olajuwon.</p>
      <p>He said, “We are waiting to see what INEC will do. But I reject in totality these fictitious results. I, Dino Melaye, won that election in the afternoon and the APC won it at night.”</p>
